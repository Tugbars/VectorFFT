# Multithreading the 3D interleaved FFT
### The partition arms, the joint race at T, and the measurement that keeps the verdicts honest

**Scope.** This paper declares how the native interleaved rank-3 c2c tier
(`src/core/transforms/fftnd/fftnd_il.h`) is parallelized on one
shared-memory socket, and — the part that generalizes to every threaded
tier in the library — how a threaded verdict is selected and measured so
that it stays consistent with the single-thread standings. Companions:
[`il2d_real_mt.md`](il2d_real_mt.md) (the 2D real tier, whose partition
this paper ports), [`measurement_arms.md`](measurement_arms.md) (F1.5, the
axis record), [`../roadmap/fftnd_il_design.md`](../roadmap/fftnd_il_design.md)
(the tier), [`../performance/v1_0_results.md`](../performance/v1_0_results.md)
(the numbers), [`../roadmap/fftnd_il_mt.md`](../roadmap/fftnd_il_mt.md)
(the eight-thread standing against the comparator: where the tier wins,
where it loses, the open form). Nothing here applies to the split rank-N tier (`fftnd.h`):
a different layout with a lane axis of its own and its own threading;
the two are never compared.

## 1. The problem

A row-major interleaved cube `N1×N2×N3` (N3 contiguous, `z[2i]` real,
`z[2i+1]` imaginary) is transformed by three commuting Kronecker factors:

| axis | pass | data shape |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | a column pass over the virtual plane of N1 rows × (N2·N3) complex | one leg stride of N2·N3 complex, contiguous counts of N2·N3 |
| 1 | a column pass per plane, N2 rows × N3 | leg stride N3, count N3 |
| 2 | a row pass over N1·N2 rows of N3 | contiguous rows |

Axes 1 and 2 together are "the per-plane structure": either a plain 2D IL
child plan per plane or the tier's own axis-1 pass plus a K=1 row plan
(the raced structure, `s=`). Axis 0 may run banded: a wide prefix of
stages, then bands of `wl` planes whose stage suffix is followed at once by
the structure on those planes while they are L2-hot (`wl=`, `cut=`).

The target is one socket: 8 performance cores with private 2 MB L2 each,
a shared L3, one memory system. There is no lane axis to slice, so every
partition is a restriction of the loop nests above over disjoint,
contiguous runs of complex values.

## 2. The partition arms

Both arms are pure loop restrictions of the serving walk: the same kernels
with the same tables run over the same elements in the same per-element
order, only the loop bounds and base pointers change. Threaded output is
therefore bitwise the serial output, and the probe gates it at every cell.

**The BAND arm** (needs a banded axis 0 with at least two bands). Each
wide prefix stage is split on its digit axis: a stage's kernel walks
digits itself, so running digits `[d0, d0+nd)` is three pointer edits
(base, table, group count) and whole planes stay with one worker; one
dispatch per stage, stages ordered. Then workers take disjoint band
ranges: a band is its suffix stages plus the fused structure on its own
planes, exchange-free, because the planes a worker finishes are the
planes it just produced. Backward mirrors the Hermitian chain: bands
first (reversed suffix, then the planes), then the reversed prefix.

**The PLANE arm** (the only arm of an unbanded or Bluestein axis 0).
Workers take disjoint column strips of the virtual plane and run the
whole axis-0 chain on them — barrier-free, because a column pass never
mixes columns; Bluestein windows share their scratch disjointly by column
range. Then workers take disjoint plane ranges for the structure.

The PLANE arm is the threaded form: over the eight-thread grid it won 528
of 534 cells, serial 3 cubes of 8 KB and less, band 3 cells. The band arm
is not raced; it serves a banked `cmt=1` and the `VFFT_ILND_MT=1` pin. Band
won by 10–17% at the tall cells with tiny planes (8192×8×2, 8192×32×4) and
lost by 10% at 256×4×4 under the longer race; plane is the default there
too.

## 3. State: clones per worker, one pool owner

The per-plane structure mutates plan state — a 2D child's scratch, the
row plan's scratch, an axis-1 Bluestein buffer — so worker t > 0 runs a
clone of it. A 2D child clone is accepted only when it is route-equivalent
to the primary (chain, kernel pointers, banded walk, N-arm, natural class,
row route, row plan); a row-plan clone only when `_tc_clone_equiv` says
so, plus its own axis-1 scratch. Clones read warm wisdom and never bank.
Any clone failure tears that structure's set down; a structure without
clones cannot thread, and with no clones at all the verdict is serial —
banked exactly like a yes. Tables are read-only and shared.

The pool has one owner (`support/threads.h`): the plan's thread count is
the snapshot, `stride_pool_workers_for` the one clamp,
`stride_pool_run` the one fork-join (measured: 68 ns at 2 workers, 272 ns
at 8, empty body). A fork-join is not what makes a small cell slow.

## 4. The verdict is raced at T, structure included

The single-thread create races the structure and the band width. That
verdict is the one a one-thread plan replays, and it is not the threaded
winner: at 64³ the two structures tie at one thread, while threaded the
child structure with the band arm runs 70 µs and the flat structure with
the plane arm 103 µs. So a plan created for T > 1 keeps both structures
alive, with their clones, until the threaded verdict, and races

    [serial(s0), cube <= 512 KB]  +  plane × {child, flat}

as arms of one race, each plane arm with a twin on half the workers
wherever the plane team below applies. Serial won up to 256 KB and never
above over about 1,500 eight-thread verdicts; the bound is one doubling
past that. The natural class threads the strip form wherever axis 0
permutes and the cycle form only where it cannot: under the longer race the
cycle form beat the strips at one such cell of the grid, 64×4096×4, by 2–9%.
The winner banks on the cell's
rank-3 row at the plan's thread count (`nthreads=` in the key, wisdom2
v1.3): `cmt=` (0 serial, 1 band, 2 plane), `cmts=` (the structure the
threaded verdict runs with) and, whenever the plane team was raced,
`cmtp=` (the workers the plane phase runs on, the full team's width
included). The one-thread row keeps its own `s=`. A verdict serves only at its own T; another T races
again. The losing structure and its clones are freed after the verdict.

**The plane team.** Every worker's structure owns a plane-sized scratch:
the 2D child's natural column scratch, or the flat structure's natural
axis-1 scratch. When the plane phase gives each worker one plane per
call, that scratch is cold on every call. Where N1 < 2·min(N1, T) and at
least four workers take planes, the plane arm also runs on half the
workers, each taking two planes or more, so the scratch is warm from the
second plane on. Measured on the flat structure at 8×128×2048, T=8: the
plane phase takes 2.6 ms on eight workers and 2.0 ms on four. The half
team is an arm, never a default: at 8×64×64 it loses to the full team by
half again (22 against 14 µs). A natural cycle-form plane phase binds its
cycles over the team it serves; a pool clamped below that team after
create folds the binding (worker b's cycles run on b mod the team), so no
plane is ever skipped.

## 5. Measuring a threaded arm

Three things were measured on the way that decide whether a threaded
number means anything. Each one produced numbers that were wrong by a
factor of 1.5 to 100 with nothing visibly broken.

**The transient.** After a pool rebuild, or after another arm ran, the
first two to three milliseconds of a threaded plan's executes run 1.5–5×
slower than its steady state (81×27×27, plane arm: round-0 mean 57–223 µs
against a steady 40 µs; 64³, band arm: 234–297 µs means for two rounds
against a steady 128). Each worker's cache partition of the cube has to
settle, and the caller core wakes from whatever the harness did between
arms. A sample that is one execute, or a handful, measures the transient.

Rule: **a threaded sample is REPS executes after warm passes**, REPS sized
from one serial timing to roughly 20 ms of serial-equivalent work and never
below 4, and the race takes the alternated minimum over enough rounds for
at least 48 timed executes per arm (3 rounds at a small cell, up to 15 at a
32–64 MB cell, where a sample holds only 4 executes: three rounds of two
could not separate arms 5–10% apart). A bench sample runs at least 5 ms of
untimed warm executes on every side before its timed reps.

**Two thread teams in one process.** Timing a threaded plan against a
threaded MKL in one process needs all of:

| trap | what happens | the rule |
|---|---|---|
| (a) our spinners | the pool's workers spin forever; seven of them steal seven cores from any MKL arm | tear the library pool down before every MKL sample, through `vfft_set_num_threads(1)` |
| (b) MKL's spinners | its OpenMP team spins `KMP_BLOCKTIME` (200 ms) after a compute | 300 ms of cool before our arm after an MKL arm |
| (c) inherited affinity | the pool pins the caller to core 0 and Windows threads inherit the creator's mask, so an OpenMP team created after our first threaded create lands on one core (3D CCE 16³ at T=8: 34 ms instead of 3 µs) | create MKL's team before any vfft plan pins anything |
| (d) a second pool | a bench TU that includes `threads.h` owns its own copy of the pool state; its startup pool is seven idle spinners on the very cores the library's workers use | never touch the pool through `stride_*` from a TU that is not `vfft.c` |

**Engagement.** A threaded plan that declines runs the serial walk and
reports a serial time under a threaded label. `vfft_ilnd_mt_passes()`
moves once per threaded execute; a result whose counter did not move for
every execute is not a threaded result. The bench prints the count per
cell; the probe asserts it.

## 6. What the standings look like once this holds

Same-run, the create race itself at T=8 (steady-state samples, min of 3):
speedup over the same tier at one thread runs from 1.5× at 27×9×15 to
8.4× at 128³, with the odd cells at 3.6–3.9× and the 512 KB cubes at
2.0–2.4×. Against MKL's CCE arm at the same T=8, the tier wins or ties
at 8 of 11 cells (128³ 2.8×, 64³ 1.5×, 64×128×32 1.5×), and loses at the
two 512 KB cubes and at 256×64×16. The figures live in
`v1_0_results.md`; this paper declares only what decides them.

The remaining losses are named levers, not defaults: the one-thread width
verdict shapes the threaded arms without being raced at T (256×64×16 flips
between `wl=32` and `wl=64` from run to run, and its threaded arms differ
by 60% between the two); and at 512 KB the two fork-joins plus a per-plane
child execute per plane cost more than MKL's single fan-out. Both are
measured items for the tier's next pass.

## 7. Verification

- `build_tuned/benches/ilnd_probe.c`, cold store, twelve cells: each
  structure env-pinned, the banded flat arm memcmp-equal to the unbanded,
  the one-thread verdict, then the same cell at T=8 — output memcmp-equal
  to the one-thread verdict's, engagement 7 of 7 executes. A warm rerun
  replays every verdict with zero races.
- `api_matrix_gate` (3D IL rows), `mt_c2c_gate` (the pool contract),
  `il2d_real_gate` (the 2D tier the clones come from).
- The plan fingerprint carries `ilnd=[arm ax0 ax1 mt=verdict/T/clones]`
  and recurses into the child and row plans.

## 8. The same method at rank 1: the odd-N flat DIT

The 1D flat mixed-radix DIT (`oop/il_flatdit.h`, odd N at K=1) threads by
the same three rules and nothing else. Its units are the bound lists' own
independent pieces (the leaf's columns, a mid stage's blocks, a tail
stage's groups) and its tiles are the tile axis's tiles, so the arms are
"blocks" (every stage by units, one dispatch per stage) and "tiles" (the
wide prefix by units, then tile ranges depth-first, then the wide tail).
The per-worker unit records are bound at plan time; nothing is cloned
because the staging plane is written in disjoint units. The verdict is
raced at T with steady-state samples, with every legal tile width as an
arm of the tiles family, and banked `il_mt= il_mt_tw=` on the plan's row at its T, the
class's kind-3 row; serial is banked below L2 and that is the verdict.
Measured at T=8, same-run: 6561 1.7×, 19683 2.7×, 59049 5.0×, 98415 5.1×,
177147 6.1× over the same tier at one thread, bitwise (flatdit_gate).
