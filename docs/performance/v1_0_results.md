# VectorFFT v1.0 — performance results

> **Where we win most — MKL's blind spot.** VectorFFT's lead over MKL is widest exactly
> where MKL invests least: **odd / mixed-radix, scrambled-order, in-place, batched.**
> Power-of-2 is MKL's home turf (decades of split-radix tuning) and our *narrowest* win
> (median **1.86×**); odd composites — where MKL falls back to generic mixed-radix / Bluestein —
> are our *fattest* (median **3.47×**, ~2× more margin). Three effects stack into that blind spot:
> (1) a DAG-compiler-tuned codelet for **every smooth radix** (not just 2/4/8), (2) **scrambled-order**
> in-place that skips the bit-reversal MKL pays, and (3) the **split lane-batched** layout that makes
> the throughput regime trivially parallel. MKL is tuned for the opposite corner: power-of-2, natural
> order, single transform. (Scrambled order is the right contract for convolution-class work — FIR
> filtering, polynomial / big-integer multiply, correlation, lattice-crypto NTT — where a fwd→bwd
> roundtrip or a pointwise multiply is order-agnostic.)

Empirical performance of VectorFFT across three axes:

1. **Wall-time vs MKL** on 1D C2C — single-thread (238 cells) and multi-threaded (the headline metric)
2. **Wall-time vs FFTW3** on 1D C2C and the r2r family (DCT/DST/DHT), single-thread
3. **Multi-threaded scaling** at T=2/4/8 across the transforms

(Plan-quality / cost-model analysis lives in its own doc: [docs/cost_model/](../cost_model/).)

All numbers are from the i9-14900KF calibration host (P-core pinned,
performance plan, single-threaded unless noted). The numbers move on
different hardware — see "Hardware caveats" at the end.

Headline:

> **VectorFFT beats MKL on 100% of bench cells (238/238). Median speedup
> 2.64×, mean 2.83×, range 1.02×–15.33×.**

The median 2.64× win comes from VectorFFT's twin advantages:
1. **Plan-level joint search** at calibration time — picks better
   factorizations than per-codelet wisdom (see
   [docs/wisdom/00_thesis.md](../wisdom/00_thesis.md)).
2. **Fully tuned codelet portfolio** — every shipped radix has
   variant codelets (FLAT / LOG3 / T1S / BUF) selected per
   `(R, me, ios)` cell.

### Arbitrary K — odd / non-multiple-of-VW batch (single-thread)

In-place c2c now accepts **any** batch K, not just `K % VW == 0`. A codelet-internal
rem-aware tail ([arbitrary_k_tail_handling.md](arbitrary_k_tail_handling.md)) covers the
`1..VW-1` leftover lanes: the bulk full-vector loop, then **`rem==1` → one scalar single
lane, `rem>=2` → one masked vector pass**. Every radix carries it — monolithic (r2–r5, r7,
primes) and composite / CT-blocked (r8, r16, r32, r64). Bit-exact at every K (`fwd+bwd ==
N·x` + a bulk-vs-tail-split diagnostic, all `corr = 0.0`).

Forward vs MKL `DFTI_INPLACE` split, `bench_inplace_oddk` `measure_ab` (best-of-5 min,
cachebust + cool, order-flip). **Each cell uses its CALIBRATED `spike_wisdom` factorization**
(odd K reuses the same N's nearest-K plan). Two methodology notes matter:
- These run the **GENERIC executor** — the only path that carries the tail today. The §1 main
  table (and the `CSV` column below) is **baked/JIT**, which is ~1.5–2× faster on multi-stage
  cells, so the *absolute* margins here sit below the baked reference (the documented "generic
  floor; `--jit` widens it"). The apples-to-apples comparison is **odd-K vs even-K on the same
  generic executor.**
- Measured on a **live host**; cells marked `*` show order-flip spread (thermal noise).

dag (8 P-cores, pinned core 0, pool K-split) vs MKL `mkl_set_num_threads(8)`, **identical split

as the single-thread table above. Source: `bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --mt` → `vfft_perf_tuned_1d_mt.csv`

### Multi-threaded — INTERLEAVED transform-contiguous batch at T=8

A second batch geometry, and the fairest MT cell in this document: DFTI with
`DFTI_NUMBER_OF_TRANSFORMS=K, DFTI_INPUT_DISTANCE=N` **is** our transform-contiguous
layout, so both engines read byte-identical memory and compute the same natural-order
spectrum — the correctness column is a cross-engine elementwise compare (~1e-16 every
cell), not a roundtrip proxy. The whole process is confined to the **8 distinct P-cores**
(affinity mask `0x5555`; logical 0,2,…,14) before any MKL/OpenMP initialization, so
neither engine can borrow E-cores or HT siblings. Source: `bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --ilmt`
→ `vfft_perf_tuned_1d_ilmt.csv`.

Four timed arms per cell — ours at T=8 and T=1, MKL at T=8 and T=1 — plus a repeat of
arm 1 as a control. Our pool is torn down before every MKL arm (our workers spin and
would otherwise steal cores), and MKL gets ≥300 ms to park its threads before ours.

**We compare against MKL's *faster* configuration, which is almost always its serial one.**
That is the finding this table exists to record: **MKL's threaded arm never beats its own
serial arm at any cell measured** — its scale column runs 0.06×–1.00×, capping exactly at
parity. This is not a mis-measurement. `MKL_VERBOSE=1` confirms the threading layer is
`intel_thread` and that the calls run at `NThr:8`; it was re-checked under three affinity
masks (`0x5555`, `0xFFFF`, unmasked) with the same result. MKL threads the work correctly
and simply loses doing so at these granularities: at 256×8 its threaded arm costs 18,828 ns
against 1,216 ns serial, 15× slower for identical math. Scoring against MKL's T=8 column
instead would inflate every ratio (median 8.25× vs the honest 3.09×) by crediting us for an
option MKL's own users would not select.

Three caveats stated plainly:

- **This is a threading-architecture win, not a kernel win.** Compare the two T=1 columns —
  that is the kernel-vs-kernel fight with threading removed. MKL leads at N ≤ 1024
  (1.18×–1.56×, worst for us at 1024); we lead from 4096 up (1.06×–1.74×). The sub-2048
  serial gap is real and is tracked separately.
  *(Update 2026-08-16: this table predates the tangent/wing32/TURNED campaign. In the
  K=1 natural-order grid below, the serial sub-2048 gap has since closed to parity —
  128 = 1.05×, 256 = 1.00×, 512 = 0.98–1.00×, 1024 ≈ 0.95-to-parity. These batched
  cells have NOT been re-measured against the new pool, so the numbers above stand
  as-measured.)*
- **Our workers never park.** Dispatch is cheap precisely because the pool spins rather than
  sleeping, which costs idle CPU and power. MKL's threads sleep after `KMP_BLOCKTIME`, which
  is better behaviour inside a host application doing other work. On this benchmark the trade
  is pure upside for us; in production it is a real cost.
- **Two cells are noise-dominated** — 256×8 (9.2% control spread) and 4096×8 (7.8%). Every
  multi-× result sits far outside its own control spread; anything inside it is not a result.

### Natural order — in-place (single-thread)

In-place c2c natively emits **digit-scrambled** order (the convolution contract — §1 headline). The
`VFFT_ORDER_NATURAL` flag (parity with MKL's `DFTI_ORDERING`) delivers **bin-for-bin natural order**
by running the same scrambled FFT plan and then a per-cell **reorder methodology**, calibrated once and
persisted as a **self-contained `@nat` record** (wisdom v8 — its own `J_nat`-optimal factorization + mode,
regime-separated from the scrambled entry so a natural create never perturbs the scrambled plan):

- **FREE** — the cell is already natural (single-stage / prime); zero extra pass.
- **PURE** — a cycle-following K-row permutation pass over the scrambled output.
- **PSWAP** — an involution **pair-swap** on a *palindromic* factorization (whose digit reversal is
  its own inverse), the cheapest possible reorder. The planner injects a palindromic chain as a
  candidate since the DP scores factorizations under scrambled economics.

Forward via the public API (`vfft_create` order=NATURAL + `vfft_execute`; the FFT is **JIT/baked**,
only the reorder pass is a memory permutation) vs MKL's natural DFTI (its default order), same
fairness as §1 (best-of-5 min, cachebust + cool + order-flip, P-core-pinned). Output order validated
**bin-for-bin** against a naive O(N²) DFT (elementwise, both natural) **plus** roundtrip
`fwd+bwd == N·x` (all e-14/e-15 every cell; see the `fwd`/`rt` gates). Source: `bench_1d_vs_mkl`-modeled

### Order × placement — the K=1 INTERLEAVED grid

The tables above are the split lane-batched path. This one is the **K=1 interleaved**
(`layout=INTERLEAVED`) story, and it differs in a way worth stating explicitly: **above
2048, natural order is a different terminator, not a reorder pass.** The `stfn` cascade
writes natural order directly from the last stage, so there is no `PURE`/`PSWAP` permutation
pass to pay — unlike the reorder methodology described immediately above, which is the
split path's mechanism. Measured through the public API, MKL has no reorder pass here
either; this is the matching design, not a divergence.

Every order × placement combination is served by a **native** engine. No convert fallback
remains anywhere in this grid — the last hole (OOP-natural ≥2048, which read 0.17× through
the convert bridge) closed 2026-08-04.

| order × placement | sub-2048 (mono ≤64 · il2p/il3p 128–1024) | ≥2048 (cascade tier) |
|---|---|---|
| **NATURAL · in-place** | native — `VFFT_NAT_ILP`: il2p/il3p aliased, raced vs convert at create, banked `@nat` | native — `VFFT_NAT_ZCASC`: `stfn` natural-terminator cascade, **no reorder pass**, raced vs tape, banked `@nat` |
| **NATURAL · OOP** | native — same IL engines, `z_in → z_out` | native — natord cascade via `@natoop` verdict + create race |
| **SCRAMBLED · in-place** | native — **identity rule**: served by the natural-native engines (the identity permutation is contract-legal; bits identical to natural, gated `IDENT`) | native — ZTURN-S digit-scrambled comb (kind-4 verdict); the comb is a REAL permutation (A3-gated) |
| **SCRAMBLED · OOP** | native — identity rule, same engines (`scr==nat` EXACT, gated) | native — kind-4 cascade attaches to the OOP handle, matched-permutation roundtrip |

**DEFAULT order** = engine-native everywhere (fastest, order-agnostic): resolves to the
scrambled-native path in-place, the calibrated winner OOP.

† vintage 2026-08-04 (not re-measured)
▲ 2026-08-06: blocked R≥32 kernels are the SHIPPED DEFAULT — a structural
register-file rule (a monolithic R≥32 body holds ~40–64 live values against
AVX2's 16 registers), not a per-cell race. Same-run A/B against the
monolithic arm, pair pinned by wisdom so only the kernels vary, 8 alternating
arms on a pinned core: 1024 −27% (0.65→0.92), 512 −8% (0.70→0.78).
◆ 256's gain needed BOTH halves and neither alone: the calibrator replaced
the heuristic balanced pair (16,16) with the measured (8,32), which puts
R=32 in the leaf slot, which the structural rule then blocks — 0.76→0.85.
Fully blocking a (16,16) pair instead was raced and LOST by 4.4%, so radix
choice dominates form choice here.
★★ 2026-08-16, the CLOSED sub-2048 campaign: tangent interiors
([tangent_scaled_butterflies.md](tangent_scaled_butterflies.md)) + the wing32
R32 forms + the TURNED store-edge axis
([store_edge_taxonomy.md](store_edge_taxonomy.md) defines T128/T256/M-128 and
the full set), all dp-raced (`calibrate_k1` over the
full form pool; verdicts banked as pair + `il_kv`). Winning rows: 128 = pair
4×32, kv 64 (mono mid + T256 wing32 leaf, 65 ns vs MKL 69); 256 = 16×16, kv 51
(tangent both slots, 136 vs 136); 512 = 16×32, kv 67 (tangent mid + T256 wing32
leaf, 296–297 vs 291–295). Canonical bench `--k1noop`, both flip orders,
cross-engine correctness 3–4e-16. The 2026-08-12 era below (★-history) first
crossed 128/256 with tangent-only forms; the wing32 leaf then solved the R32
slot (the old "+32% killed leaf" was an edge×interior interaction, not the
tangent construction) and the TURNED axis picked the store edge per cell.
Historical ★ numbers: 128 1.04 (8×16, kv 51) · 256 1.01–1.02 · 512 0.87–0.88
(kv 35, pre-wing32) — superseded by the rows above.
✦ 2026-08-16, 6 reps, both flip orders, canonical bench: ours
848/889/893/901/978/987 ns vs MKL 833/841/854/860/864/873 — **median ratio
0.96, best-vs-best 0.98, one rep at 1.02**. The route is CLASSIC blocked 32×32
**re-raced against the complete form pool** (tangent, wing32, both TURNED
edges) and re-confirmed by the dp with the nearest challenger +4.5% behind:
1024's regime is memory (L1 pending misses ~19× the 512 level, store-latency
bound), where the tangent family's port/instruction levers buy nothing. The
cell's variance is dominated by MKL's own in-place shadow-plane placement
(its floor alone spans 833–873 here; historically 812–905), so the honest
datum is **~0.95-to-parity** — do not quote a third digit. (The 2026-08-12
figure 0.83–0.90 came from a noisier 5-rep set on the same route.)
‡ pre-tangent plan. The banked kind-3 row for this N CHANGED on 2026-08-12, so
the in-place figure no longer describes what ships. Sub-2048 in-place and OOP
run the SAME IL engines (see the grid above), so it is expected to track the
OOP column — but it has not been re-measured, and is not quoted as if it had.
▢ engine serves it; no banked table yet    (= NAT bits) identity rule
```

Reading it honestly:

- **Sub-2048 K=1 natural is AT PARITY — the campaign is closed (2026-08-16).**
  128 = 1.05×, 256 = 1.00×, 512 = 0.98–1.00×; 1024 sits at ~0.95-to-parity with its
  variance dominated by MKL's own in-place shadow-plane placement (see ✦). The tier's
  final architecture: **tangent/wing interiors own the L1-resident cells, classic
  blocked owns the memory-bound cell (1024 — re-raced against the full pool, classic
  won by 4.5%), and the store edge (TURNED-128 vs -256) is a per-cell raced axis, not
  a default** — T256 won at 128/512 on this machine, and the losing forms stay in the
  pool as inventory for other platforms. Remaining known headroom, parked at the
  owner's wrap: 3-stage chains (+7.6–8.8% at 512, measured twice, never banked).
  *(The paragraphs below record the mid-campaign analysis that got here — the R32
  census and its levers. Historical: the wing32 forms subsequently solved the R32
  slot and the "cannot form a both-slots pair at 512" constraint dissolved.)*
  A like-for-like census against
  MKL's own 32-point column kernel (`mkl512__col32_fwd_loop.asm`, same work unit: 32 ymm
  loads → 32 ymm stores, twiddles hoisted as constants) says the opposite of the obvious
  inference:

  | | MKL col32 | ours `n1tb48` |
  |---|--:|--:|
  | instructions | **460** | 563 |
  | fma / bare mul | **68 / 0** | 36 / 20 |
  | naked add+sub | 118 (**63%**) | 152 (73%) |
  | shuffle + xor | **54 + 15** | 82 + 29 |
  | stack ops | **78 (0.42/fp-op)** | 48 (0.23/fp-op) |

  **MKL spills 1.6× more per arithmetic op than we do and still wins.** It treats stack
  traffic as cheap and buys instruction count and FMA density with it — 18% fewer
  instructions, 1.9× the FMAs, *zero* bare multiplies. So "reduce spills" is the wrong
  lever against MKL; the right ones are instruction count and naked-add/bare-mul
  elimination, which is the direction the tangent construction already pushes. A second,
  independent lever is visible in the same table: our interleaved-complex sign/lane
  handling costs **42 extra shuffle+xor instructions**, roughly 40% of the whole
  103-instruction gap, and has nothing to do with tangent.
  ⚠ **Regime matters when quoting these**: this column is the single-transform K=1
  natural-order cell, the one that has always been hardest. The same N wins comfortably
  batched — 1024 is 1.57× at K=256 OOP (see the table below) — and the scrambled column
  leads everywhere ≥2048. Do not read a sub-2048 K=1 number as the library's position.
- **Historical context for the ▲ cells** (superseded by the above but the mechanism
  still holds): the ▲ cells run the blocked
  R≥32 kernels as the shipped default — a structural rule (a monolithic R≥32 body holds
  ~40–64 live values against AVX2's 16 registers and spills ~27% of its stream; blocked
  construction is the only body shape that fits, the same tier the split emitters apply
  at generation time), not a measured per-cell pick. A side observation from the A/B
  worth keeping: the monolithic arm's own spread at 1024 was 36% between two runs while
  the blocked arm's pair agreed to 0.5% — a spill-bound body is at the mercy of ambient
  load in a way a register-resident one is not. 256 moved 0.76→0.85 only once the
  calibrator replaced its heuristic (16,16) pair with the measured (8,32) — the pair
  verdict is what put an R≥32 body in a slot the blocked rule could act on, so neither
  half would have delivered it alone.
- **Remaining levers for the two cells still behind (512, 1024)**, in order of measured
  promise: (1) an **R32 blocking geometry co-designed with the tangent constant set** —
  the spill census above localizes the loss precisely, and both remaining cells are the
  R32-bound ones, so this single lever addresses both; (2) the stage-count axis (3-stage
  chains beat every 2-stage pair at 512 by +7.6–8.8%, measured twice, not yet banked).
  Two things are now *closed* rather than open: a hand-wired fully-tangent 512 is a wash
  (~1%), so more tangent at the current geometry is not the answer; and R=64 is no longer
  the "last structural gap" — 1024's problem is that it is R32 in *both* slots, which an
  R=64 kernel does not address.
- **≥2048 is parity-or-win** on every row except natural-OOP at 4096/32768.
- **The SCRAMBLED row leads everywhere ≥2048, and the reason is structural rather than
  a kernel advantage**: setting `DFTI_ORDERING` to `DFTI_BACKWARD_SCRAMBLED` does not
  change MKL's output ordering (the setting reads back as applied, but the spectrum is
  unchanged — verified through the public API), so MKL has no scrambled mode. That row
  therefore races our structurally cheaper path against their only path. It is a fair
  comparison of what each library can actually deliver for a scrambled-order consumer,
  not a like-for-like kernel comparison.

Batching rides this grid unchanged: the canonical `VFFT_BATCH_TRANSFORM_CONTIGUOUS`
geometry runs K independent K=1 transforms, so every cell above applies per transform at
every K, with no batch tail, no padding and no even-K constraint.

### Out-of-place — arbitrary K (odd / non-multiple-of-8 batch)

The OOP path used to fail-closed on `K % 8 != 0`. It now serves **any K**, across all three
kinds, via a **codelet-internal rem-aware tail** (the same contract as the in-place tail,
`docs/performance/arbitrary_k_tail_handling.md`): the bulk full-vector loop, then for the
`1..VW-1` leftover batch lanes **`rem==1` → one scalar single lane, `rem>=2` → one masked
vector pass**. The scalar lane is rendered monolithically (no register pressure at width 1).
Two of the three kinds keep **natural order** at odd K:
- **MODEB** (scrambled) rides the tailed in-place codelets (n1 OOP wrapper) — any K, free.
- **LEAF** (natural, N≤128) — the `n1_oop` leaf carries the tail.
- **BAILEY2** (natural, all N) — a new **per-lane `t1_oop`** second-stage codelet + a per-group
  twiddle table replace `t1p`'s per-VW-block broadcast (which straddles k2 boundaries at odd K).

Forward measured vs MKL `NOT_INPLACE` split, calibrated OOP wisdom loaded for the aligned cell
(K=32) and `dp_best` for the odd cells (no wisdom entry); best-of-5 min, cachebust + cool,
order-flip. The chooser picks the fastest kind per cell; odd-K natural-order is available
whenever LEAF/BAILEY2 win.

### K=1 INTERLEAVED — N = 2^a·odd, the ZTURN-T odd band vs MKL (2026-09-15)

N = 2^a·m with m a product of 3, 5, 7, 9 and 15 (a ≥ 4, 2048..262144: 339
sizes) is ZTURN-T's **odd band** (`docs/design/ztt_odd_design.md`): the same
engine as the pow2 band with the odd radix as a **mid** stage — the ingest
and the terminators are radix-4/8 lane lattices, the mids' edges are
radix-agnostic — executed **staged** (one stage-kernel call per stage and
block, the fused codelets being the pow2 solution's form only). Both order
classes: natural with the `tlf` terminator, scrambled with the plain
schedule. The planner races the chain grammar (the odd part decomposed
largest-first, its mids at every interior position, the pow2 slots over
{4, 8}) times the tile ladder 8/16/32/48 KB per cell; the row banks
`il_route=ztt il_ztt=<chain> il_tw=<width>`. This replaces the odd
ZTURN-S cascade of 2026-08-27 (its 1.46–1.62× vs MKL, scrambled contract
against MKL's natural); the cascade serves no cell in the band.

vs **MKL DFTI** through the front door with the canonical bench
(`bench_1d_vs_mkl --k1noop` = natural out of place on both engines,
`--k1nat` = natural in place on both, `mkl_set_num_threads(1)`), one fresh
process per cell, core 2 + HIGH, 300 ms pace, 400 ms cool, a cold scratch
store (every cell races at create). **Natural order on both sides** — the
same spectrum, bin for bin (the 08-27 table compared our scrambled contract
against MKL's natural):

Against what the door served before it (`probes/ZT/zt_odd_spike_results.md`,
paced core-2 races): the natural class beats chain3 out of place and the
cascade's natural path in place by 9–47% at 3072, 12288 and 245760; the
plain (scrambled) class beats the cascade's comb in place everywhere and
out of place above L2, and trails it out of place at L2 sizes forward by
0–8% (the pow2 class's known forward weakness; owner's ruling 2026-09-15:
the cascade is not kept for it). Correctness: `benches/ztt_odd_gate.c` —
staged equals fused bitwise at every pow2 registry cell, 17 odd chains
exact against a scalar DFT, in place / tiles / alignment bitwise, and the
front door banks ZTURN-T odd chains in both order classes.

Found on the way and fixed the same day: the chain3 enumerator pushed every
divisor split of N/R2 without checking kernels — 899 at 245760 — overflowing
the candidate cap; the planner refused the cell and Bluestein served it at
4.7 ms (0.24×). Kernels that do not exist are no longer candidates, and
ZTURN-T enumerates first in the natural pool.

### K=1 scrambled cascade — intra-transform MT (2026-08-27)

The single-transform zturn cascade (ord=scr, OOP) threads its own walk:
ingest and terminator count-split, mid stages group-split (the digit
axis), tiled cells run their tiles as self-contained units (fused tiles
carry their own terminator cut). No clones — one read-only plan, the
sectioned plane partitioned disjointly. **The engage decision is RACED
per cell at create** and a losing cell serves serial; kill/force
`VFFT_ZT_NO_MT`, engagement counter `vfft_zt_mt_passes()`.

**Speedup over the SAME plan at one thread** (not a vs-MKL arm — MKL
auto-threads 1D C2C at N≥8192, and that comparison is a future
same-run measurement). T=8, same-run alternated, min-of-20, MT == ST
bitwise gated at every N including forced-on:

```
 N        fwd      bwd      raced verdict
──────────────────────────────────────────
 2048       —        —      serial (0.84× forced)
 4096       —        —      serial (0.72× forced)
 8192       —        —      serial (marginal, ~1.1–1.2×)
 16384    2.54×    2.16×    threaded
 65536    3.89×    4.04×    threaded
 262144   5.43×    5.27×    threaded
──────────────────────────────────────────
```

The knee sits exactly where the barrier+exchange cost meets the
transform's work; the race finds it per cell rather than by a constant.

### K=1 INTERLEAVED natural order — ZTURN-T beside the pairs and the cascade (2026-09-09)

ZTURN-T (route 9, `src/core/oop/ztt.h`; `docs/design/zturn_t_ship_plan.md`,
`zturn_t_2048plus_plan.md`) is the run-contiguous DIT: a packed-through
ingest into a plane of runs, in-place mid stages with one twiddle stream per
stage, a REINT terminator that writes natural order, ONE fused driver per
cell (zero calls), every stream expanded from a baked quarter-wave. It is
raced per cell by the dp planner beside the pairs (below 2048) and, at 2048
and above, as the K=1 plan the natural door races against the natord
ZTURN-S cascade; above 2048 its TILE WIDTH is a raced axis (`il_tw=`, the
cascade's 1 KB..64 KB ladder; untiled is a candidate too). The best is
served; below 2048 the pairs keep several cells by measurement.

**16..2048** (`probes/ZT/phaseD_verdict.sh`): the canonical bench in
`--k1noop` mode (K=1 natural OOP through the front door, MKL DFTI in the
same process), one fresh process per (cell, run), 7 runs, 12 s cooldowns,
alternated order, core 2 + HIGH, best-of-5 trials per process:

The untiled arrangement alone (`phaseE_2048plus.sh`, its own best chains
8.8.8.8 / 8.8.8.4.4 / 8.8.8.8.4) measured 3768 / 8783 / 18358 ns against the
cascade's 4100 / 8919 / 19003 and MKL's 3854 / 8546 / 18702 — ahead of the
cascade everywhere and at MKL parity except 8192 (0.97). The tile closes
8192 (1.05) and is noise-level at 4096 and 16384 on this clock; the
planner's own clock prefers it at all three, and the race decides per cell.

**In place, 2048..16384** (`probes/ZT/phaseE3_inplace.sh`: `--k1nat`,

In place costs ZTURN-T 5..11% over its out-of-place time (an out-of-place
engine through a scratch plane, MKL's own in-place shape; MKL's tax is
1..6%). The in-place door banks the engine at all four cells; 16384 is a tie
cell on the door's clock (ILP 2 of 3 cool-box races) and the bench's cascade
win there sits inside ZTURN-T's spread.

**Scrambled order, 2048..16384** (`probes/ZT/phaseE4_scr.sh`: the bench's
default mode = an explicit SCRAMBLED K=1 OOP request through the front door
vs MKL natural OOP in the same process; 7 paced runs per arm). SCRAMBLED
means order-agnostic: every engine that answers with a self-consistent
permutation competes in the cell's race, natural output included, and the
scrambled door banks the winner. ZTURN-T, writing natural order, beats the
cascade's digit-reversed comb at every cell:

```

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

That table is the 2026-09-09 world. Since 2026-09-14 **order is a contract**
(`design_contracts.md` 8b): a scrambled request is served by a scrambled
writer only, and at every pow2 cell 16..262144 that writer is the
**scrambled ZTURN-T class** — the plain schedule (`ztt_scrambled_design.md`:
in-place Sande-Tukey on the chain, post-twiddle, no scatter, no plane, one
sweep fewer than natural), banked on the `ord=scr` row with the same
tokens. Measured against the natural class on the same chain and tile
(`probes/ZT/zt_scr_spike_results.md`, paced core-2 races): **in place it is
faster at every cell from 2048 up, both directions** (−3..−6% at 2048..8192,
−5..−10% at 16384, −11/−15% at 32768, −17/−26% at 65536, −20..−30% at
131072..262144); out of place the backward is at parity from 16384 and
wins above L2, the forward loses 5..30% at 2048..65536 and wins above L2
(the class's one open item); below 2048 it costs ~11% and is served
regardless, the contract being the contract. It is not benched against
MKL: MKL's DFTI serves natural order, a different contract.

ZTURN-T serves every pow2 cell to 262144 since 2026-09-09 (the two-level
create above the quarter-wave's octave) and the 2^a·odd band since
2026-09-15 (the section above). The cascade itself was deleted from the
library on 2026-09-15, and ZTURN-T's own **threaded arm** took over T > 1
the same day (`docs/design/ztt_mt_design.md`: the stage walk sectioned
across the pool, bitwise the serial result, raced and banked per thread
count on the cell's row). Its measurements — T = 8 speedups of 1.4-2x at
12288..16384, 3.3-5.4x at 65536, 6.2-7.9x at 245760..262144, and 1.51-1.87x
over MKL at 8 threads through the canonical bench at 12288..262144 — are in
`probes/ZT/zt_mt_spike_results.md`. The natural door's race
buffers were made 64-B aligned on 2026-09-09; before that its 16-B `malloc`
buffers split ZTURN-T's stores across lines and banked the cascade at 4096
against this verdict.

### K=1 INTERLEAVED — the upper band 2^19..2^22, the four-step vs MKL (2026-09-15)

Above ZTURN-T's ceiling the K=1 interleaved cell is the FOUR-STEP (route
10, `src/core/oop/k1_fourstep.h`, `docs/design/k1_fourstep_design.md`):
N = N1 x N2 on the 2D interleaved tier — the column chain and the fused row
pass of a rank-2 cell (its own raced verdicts: chain, band width, ZTURN-T
rows at 2048 and 4096), the inter-pass twiddle multiplied into the row pass
as two-level records — and, for the natural class, one blocked AVX2
transpose with the column permutation folded in (streaming stores, cut
across the pool). The scrambled class is the plane as it stands. The split
is a raced verdict per cell at one thread and, separately, per thread count
(`il_pair` / `il_mt`): the children's threaded verdicts reorder the ladder.
At 262144 the four-step's splits race beside ZTURN-T's chains in the same
cell and ZTURN-T keeps it.

Canonical bench, `--k1noop` (natural, out of place, both engines in one

(the 2M and 4M rows re-measured 2026-09-16 on a quiet machine after the
per-thread split verdicts were re-raced; the other rows stand from
2026-09-15.) Elementwise vs MKL 5.7e-16..2.7e-15 at every cell. What the
numbers say:
the natural class's whole cost over the scrambled class is the transpose
(the store's race times at one thread: scrambled 1.15 / 2.81 / 6.34 /
14.95 ms at 2^19..2^22 against natural 1.41 / 3.12 / 7.30 / 17.58 ms), and
that transpose is bandwidth: the scalar 16 x 16 walk it shipped with ran
10.3 ms at 1024 x 4096 against 2.9 ms for the lane-permute + streaming
kernel (`benches/tp_probe.c`: block size, loop order and store kind raced,
one and eight threads) — the scalar kernel lost every cell at one thread
(0.67-0.94x) and this one wins them. At T=8 the 4194304 cell is at parity:
a 64 MB plane is at the DRAM roof in every phase (73-75 GB/s), so its time
is its sweep count, and every form raced to cut a sweep — column strips,
a fused stage pair, a natural-child fold, the super-band fold of the
transpose — either lost or landed inside the race's own spread
(`docs/design/il2d_large_plane_design.md`). The 2^a·odd cells above
262144 are not served.

Reproduce: `k1_fourstep_gate.exe <store> 4194304 8 262144` (races and
banks the band on a store; ALL PASS = the gate), then
`bench_1d_vs_mkl --k1noop [--mt] <store>/spike_wisdom.txt <csv> 300 <N> 1 300 <flip> 2`
with `VFFT_WISDOM_DIR=<store>`; `benches/fs_split_probe.exe <store> <N>..`
times both classes at T=1 and T=8 (`VFFT_K1_FS=N1xN2` pins a split).

Reproduce: `calibrate_k1.exe <scratch> 1 4096 8192 16384` (scratch copy of
`generated/`), `probes/ZT/natoop_restamp.exe <scratch> 4096 8192 16384`,
then `sh probes/ZT/phaseE2_2048plus.sh` (`SKIP_CAL=1` re-runs the bench
only; the script refuses a second concurrent instance).

### K=1 INTERLEAVED — PRIME N, the prime cell's own raced method and inner (2026-09-19)

A prime N in the K=1 interleaved tier is a convolution done with an FFT of
length M (Rader: M = N - 1; Bluestein: M = the next power of two >= 2N - 1,
`src/core/oop/il_prime.h`). Since 2026-09-18 the prime cell RACES both the
METHOD and its INNER together
(`docs/design/ilprime_inner_race_design.md`): every buildable (method, inner)
pair, timed on the whole convolution, in heats of sixteen with a same-run
final, the winner banked on the prime cell's own row (`eng=`, `in=`, `in_sh=`,
`in_tw=`) and replayed from there. The inner pool is the K=1 planner's own --
every il2p pair and the il3p chain below 4096, and above it the ZTURN-T
enumerators, power-of-two and 2^a*odd, each with its own tile ladder.

Canonical bench, `--k1noop` (natural, out of place, T = 1, both engines in one

```

The split between the two methods is not written anywhere. Rader turns a
prime into a cyclic convolution of length N - 1, so it can only be built when
the inner pool can express N - 1, and it is offered as race arms exactly then.
Below 4096 the pool draws on every il2p pair and the il3p chain, so any radix
with a codelet counts -- which is why 521 rides `8.5.13`. Above 4096 the inner
must be a ZTURN-T chain, whose odd mids are 3, 5, 7, 9 and 15, so a prime
whose N - 1 carries 13, 17, 683 or 257 offers Rader nothing and Bluestein
takes the cell unopposed and correctly. That is the textbook rule -- smooth
predecessors favour Rader, rough ones favour Bluestein -- arrived at by
construction rather than by a threshold.

Every cell is above parity. The four largest Rader wins are new on 2026-09-19:
Rader carried a hard 4096 ceiling left over from an older inner rule, so
4001, 12289, 40961 and 65537 had all been banking Bluestein without a contest.
65537 went from 1.04x to 4.82x on that one line, our own time from 1.71 ms to
0.38 ms.

Primes on `bench_1d_vs_mkl`'s own split-library prime list (127, 251, 257,
263, 401, 641, 1009, ...) used to be intercepted there and benched on its
`[override]` path even under `--k1noop`, so the "Rader primes" and "Bluestein
primes" categories of section 1 are that SPLIT path, in place, and are not
comparable to this table. The interception was removed on 2026-09-19; 257
reads 0.30x on the old path and 3.15x through the front door.

The same cell serves COMPOSITE lengths with no chain, since Bluestein needs
no primality (2026-09-19). Before that a composite above 2048 was refused --
not for want of an algorithm but for want of an inner, its structural rule
stopping at M = 4096. Four that had refused: 2101 = 11 x 191 at 0.95, 3005 =
5 x 601 at 1.34, 3007 = 31 x 97 at 1.35, 3013 = 23 x 131 at 1.33, all agreeing
with MKL elementwise to 1e-15. Twenty consecutive lengths from 3000 went from
five served to twenty.

Reproduce: `sh prime_vs_mkl.sh <out-dir>` from `build_tuned/` (a scratch copy
of the shipped store; `recal_1d_probe.exe <store> <N> 0 0 1 0` races and banks
each cell, then the bench as above with `VFFT_WISDOM_DIR=<store>`);
`VFFT_ILPR_LOG=1` on the create prints each method's pool and how much of it
built. Rebuild both binaries on the current tree first: a stale bench benches
the old code without a word, and a stale one here REFUSED 65537 outright
because it replayed a Rader verdict it could not build.

### K=1 INTERLEAVED — the flat DIT's radix pool reaches 17 and 19 (2026-09-19)

The flat DIT enumerated chains from a pool that stopped at 13, while the
interleaved registry has had 17 and 19 for as long as the 2D column chain has
been using them, and every kind this engine needs exists at both (`n1c` for
the leaf, `t2cp` for a mid, `t2cs`/`t2csg` for a tail; only the optional
split-body `msz` form stops at 15, and that is a per-stage choice, not an
admission rule).

The cells that suffered are those needing FOUR or more odd stages, one of
them 17 or 19. No pair reaches them (both halves must be <= 64), the
three-factor chain cannot group them into three pieces that all have kernels,
and ZTURN-T's odd grammar admits only 3, 5, 7, 9 and 15. So they fell through
every factoring route to the prime cell, which convolved them at the next
power of two:

```
 N                      before                        after
 6545  = 5.7.11.17      0.27 / 0.42   prime cell      1.26 / 1.21   flat DIT 5.11.17.7
 12155 = 5.11.13.17     0.34 / 0.40   prime cell      1.02 / 1.20   flat DIT 13.17.11.5
```

At 6545 our own time went from 78.1 us to 17.1 us. Two pool entries, no new
kernels, no new engine.

**A measurement lesson worth more than the fix.** The first A/B used 969 and
1615, which have exactly three prime factors and are therefore covered by the
three-factor chain: the new arms competed, lost, and the run-to-run spread
(1.12 against 1.92 at 1615, same route, same factors, different stage order)
was read as the result. A pool change can only be measured at a cell the pool
change makes REACHABLE. And a single-sample race cannot A/B a pool change at
all, because adding arms perturbs the race that decides the winner.

### K=1 INTERLEAVED — every N from 2 to 2048 vs MKL, the gauntlet (2026-09-21)

One contract, every length: 1D c2c, K=1, natural order, out of place, one
thread. Each cell was created through the front door on a scratch copy of
the shipped store (the library's own race banked the verdict into
`wisdom2_oop.txt` / `wisdom2_prime.txt`), then timed by the canonical bench
against MKL in its own process, core 2 + HIGH, cachebust + 300 ms cool
between engines, BOTH engine orders (flip 0 and 1), best-of-5 after 10
warmups. 2047 cells, 4094 rows in
`build_tuned/results/gauntlet_2026-09-20/gauntlet.csv`; the control cell
(4096, every 100 cells) read 1.01-1.09x across 46 readings with two
disturbed windows, so the run is internally comparable. Max roundtrip error
2.5e-15. The tree measured: radix 23 at every interleaved kind, the flat
DIT admitting a radix-2 leaf when N/2 is odd, and the il2p kernel resolvers
deriving their radix sets from the generated registry; the 194 cells those
three reach were re-raced and re-timed on that tree and their rows replaced
the originals. Every ratio below is MKL time / our time, the WORSE of the
two flips.

Most of the range is a composite with a prime factor of 29 or more (1157 of
2047 cells), and those are served by the prime cell -- Bluestein or Rader on
the WHOLE length -- while MKL runs a mixed-radix plan with a prime stage.
That is where the losses are; the standing families:

```

 chain3, 11/13-heavy, 1000..2048           ~16   0.63-0.78  16   consistent in both flips; radix 13 is the weak kernel (0.92x where 17/19/23 run 1.4x)

```

**The Rader finding.** Rader never lost a race it entered. Of the 202 primes
that bank Bluestein, nearly all have a prime above 23 in N-1 (47: 46 = 2.23
needs a 2-led inner the prime pool does not offer; 83: 82 = 2.41; 263: 262 =
2.131), so the inner pool offers Rader NO length-(N-1) plan and the verdict
is Bluestein by default. Where Rader can build (98 primes, including the
twelve whose inner runs through radix 23: 139 = 6.23, 277 = 12.23, 1013 =
4.11.23, 1657 = 8.9.23) it banks at a median 1.82x; a Bluestein prime runs a
median 1.77x slower than its nearest Rader neighbour (83: 467 ns beside 89:
223; 263: 2091 beside 271: 810). Every prime congruent to 3 mod 4 has N-1 =
2 x odd, so the prime cell's inner pool lacking the flat DIT's 2-led chains
and the missing prime stage are the same defect seen from two sides.

22 primes whose N-1 IS buildable banked Bluestein anyway (421, 433, 757,
1009, 1021, 1373, 1597, ...): single cold races, to be re-raced before the
merge. Cell 515 raced, printed banked, and has no row (a persist failure, since
fixed).

**A bench finding.** VectorFFT's two readings at a cell differ by more than
25% at 163 cells; MKL's at 2. The chain3 route carries it: 47 cells slower
when timed AFTER MKL, 8 when timed first; every other route is symmetric.
The plan and the buffers exist before either engine runs, so it is not
allocation order. Unexplained; a targeted probe (one chain3 cell, both
orders, repeated) is the next step.

### K=1 INTERLEAVED — the same 2047 cells IN PLACE (2026-09-21)

The same contract with placement flipped: natural order, IN PLACE, K=1, one
thread, every N from 2 to 2048, against MKL with DFTI_INPLACE, the same
bench discipline (core 2 + HIGH, cachebust + cool, both flips, best-of-5),
rows in `build_tuned/results/gauntlet_2026-09-20/gauntlet_ip.csv`. NOT an
in-place calibration: the in-place door of this tree does not race the cell
in place -- it serves the OUT-OF-PLACE engine row through a reference row
`mode=ilp ref=cell(... place=oop ...)` and executes it in place (owner,
2026-09-21: that is wrong; the in-place cell is its own contract and must
race its arms executed in place). So this table prices in-place EXECUTION
of the out-of-place verdicts, and stands until the in-place race exists.
Max roundtrip error 2.6e-15. Ratio = MKL / ours, worse of the two flips; the last two
columns are each library's own in-place time over its out-of-place time.

```

In-place execution is free below 2048: our in-place time is the
out-of-place time at every route (median 0.99x), MKL's likewise, and no cell
is served by a different engine in place. The two exceptions are the
ZTURN-T cells: 2048 runs 14% slower in place (1826 against 1602 ns; 1.09x
against 1.23x vs MKL) and 16 loses its margin (0.90x).

**The chain3 engine has two speeds.** In both placements about one chain3
cell in five reads bimodal across the two flips (53 of 281 out of place, 51
in place), the slow reading 1.3-1.6x the fast one, and out of place the slow
reading is the one taken after MKL ran (44 of 53). No other route does this
(pair 5 of 127, flat 8 of 108, and the prime cell's inner is a pair or
chain). The engine runs three passes through two plan-owned staging buffers
of the transform's own size, 64-byte aligned, beside the caller's input and
output of the same size: four equal-sized streams whose page offsets are
decided by the heap, so a process either lands them on distinct cache sets
or on the same ones. The out-of-place run's 163 flip disagreements are this
one route. The fix is allocator-side, one arena with a deliberate skew
between the two staging buffers, to be proven by a same-process A/B before
it ships.

## 2. vs MKL — 2D C2C

dag tiled 2D (`fft2d.h`, B=8: gather→K=B row FFT→scatter via SIMD transpose, native
column pass) vs MKL DFTI 2D (split, `DFTI_NOT_INPLACE`), single-thread, same fairness
as §1 (per-cell order-flip, cachebust + pace, best-of-5, ns timing). dag is **in-place,
scrambled order** (DIT); MKL is natural order — so the definitive correctness gate is the
roundtrip `fwd+bwd == N1·N2·x` (all e-14/e-15), and `elem≈1e0` just confirms the scramble.
Source: `bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --2d` → `vfft_perf_tuned_2d.csv`.

The plan comes from a dedicated **PATIENT 2D c2c calibration** (own `fft2d_c2c_wisdom`,
scored *end-to-end on the 2D transform* — PATIENT is the recommended planner; MEASURE is
the fast mode, exhaustive `stride_plan_2d` the wisdom-miss fallback). Inner row/col FFTs
are baked-or-JIT resolved (`--jit`). Measured **cooled** (20 s pre-cool + 30 s between
runs), median of 3. Source: `bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --2d --jit` → `vfft_perf_tuned_2d.csv`.

*64² falls back to exhaustive — its PATIENT-banked plan was a calibration **noise
artifact** (a 5 µs cell is below reliable timing; the gate happened to measure exhaustive
slow at a hot moment). Exhaustive's 64² plan is measurably faster (~4.8 µs vs ~6.8 µs).

Same cells, dag 2D threaded vs MKL `mkl_set_num_threads(8)`, identical split layout,
order-flipped + paced, **with an MT-vs-ST forward gate** (threaded fwd must equal the
single-thread fwd bit-for-bit — folded into rt; all e-14, so the tile-parallel path is
race-free). dag threads the **row pass only** (tile-parallel pool, per-thread scratch);
the **column pass stays serial** — that's the 2D self-scaling ceiling. Source:

### 2D C2C — the NATIVE INTERLEAVED tier vs MKL CCE (standing as of 2026-09-15)

The native interleaved 2D tier (`docs/roadmap/fft2d_il_c2c_design.md`:
n1c/t2c column chain + K=1 IL row pass, per-cell raced chain, blocked
r32/r64 bodies; served here via `VFFT_IL2D_NATIVE=1`, single-thread).
⚠ **Scope note:** this is the first section measured against **MKL's BEST
2D arm** — rank-2 `DFTI_COMPLEX_COMPLEX`, in-place (its measured-fastest
configuration). The §2 tables above compare against `DFTI_REAL_REAL`
split, which the same runs measured **1.1–1.3× slower than MKL's CCE arm**
(`M-split/M-inter` column) — quote them with that scoping.

Arms (one process, `bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --2dil`, front door only, 9 rounds
with reversed arm order, cachebust between arms, medians; engagement of
the native tier VERIFIED per cell by output-order comparison): O-NATIVE =
the native tier; O-inter = the previous serving (deinterleave → split 2D →
reinterleave); O-split = our split 2D engine; M-inter = MKL CCE in-place.
Correctness behind the numbers: forward ELEMENTWISE vs a naive separable
DFT per direction, the pair contract (bwd consumes the plan's own comb →
N·x), and race→bank→serve replay bitwise with roundtrip ~5e-16 — the
`il2d_m1_gate` battery, ALL PASS.

```

"rows" = the engine the row child's own 1D verdict serves: the K=1 pairs
below 1024, ZTURN-T at 1024 and in its band (the row pass is a K=1 plan
through the front door, so the 2D tier never names an engine;
`docs/design/ztt_2d_design.md`). † = re-measured 2026-09-15 on the same
bench with the same column verdicts once ZTURN-T served those rows
(1024×1024 was 2.08×, 16×4096 1.50× at 102,410 ns, 512×512 1.91× from the
pair-pool work of 09-09/11); 4096×64 keeps its 08-25 row — a 09-15 reading
of 1.1× came with a 45% control spread and was ruled thermal.

The ×64 rows are the L2 band-threshold ladder (same-day addendum
below: measured with the cascade widths in the race). 16384/32768 are
outside-noise results; at 32768 MKL's
CCE arm loses even to its own REAL_REAL configuration (0.76).

*aspect-cell arm spreads were wide in that run (up to 56% on the MKL arm,
196% on one native arm) — the ratios there are sign-reliable, not
two-decimal quotable; the square cells ran at 6–25% spreads.
**Huge-column cells + the L2 cascade widths (2026-08-25, same-day
addendum).** Long-column cells added to the `--2dil` ladder: band
residency needs `wl ≤ L2/(16·N1)`, so the static width pool (max 256)
pinned the cut deep at N1 ≥ 16384 and multiple wide stages streamed the
full plane (measured: per-point 1.9× off the memcpy floor at 32768×64
while the floor itself moved 1.3×). Fix: the stage spans `L[s]` join the
width race when `w·N2·16 ≤ vfft_cpu_l2_bytes()` (live CPUID via
`cpu_cache.h`, the hardware-derived gate — never a platform constant,
never a full dual-architecture search). The race picked `wl=1024` at
32768×64 (`chain=32.32.32 tf=1`), gate bitwise-green, and the knee cells
moved to **16384×64 = 1.37×, 32768×64 = 1.66× vs MKL CCE** (both outside
noise; MKL's CCE arm itself loses to its own REAL_REAL there, 0.76–0.79).
Derived from separate same-run ladders, not one toe-to-toe run.

The ladder rows are merged into the main table above (the four ×64
cells). The banked verdicts (13 `lay=il` cells incl.
`32768x64 chain=64.16.32 wl=1024`) now ship in
`generated/wisdom2_2d.txt` — a fresh install serves them without
re-calibrating.

### 2D C2C — the native tier MULTITHREADED (2026-08-27)

Both passes of the native IL tier thread. Rows commute with column
stages in c2c (the same ℂ-linearity that legalizes tfuse), so a banded
cell's unit of work is a **self-contained band** — its suffix stages
plus its own fused rows — and workers own disjoint band ranges with no
rows/columns wall; only the wide prefix stages split on the digit axis
(three pointer edits per the emitted kernel, zero new codelets).
Single-stage cells split by column strips then row slabs. The shared
row child is cloned per worker (route-equivalence-checked at create).
**The engage decision is raced per cell and banked** (`cmt=` + the
thread count raced at, `cmtt=`, in the `lay=il` cell — a verdict
serves only at its own T); kill/force `VFFT_IL2D_NO_COLMT`; engagement
counter `vfft_il2d_col_mt_passes()`.

**Speedup over the SAME tier at one thread**, T=8, same-run alternated
min-of-20, MT == ST bitwise gated both directions:

### 3D C2C — the NATIVE INTERLEAVED tier vs MKL CCE (standing as of 2026-09-15)

The rank-3 interleaved tier (`docs/roadmap/fftnd_il_design.md`,
`docs/design/3D_natural_il_design.md`, `ilnd_natural_strip_design.md`,
`src/core/transforms/fftnd/fftnd_il.h`), both order classes, either
placement (in place is the same plan and the same wisdom row; its output
is bitwise the out-of-place output, probe-gated at one thread and at T=8):

- **Axis 0** = the 2D column-axis pass over the virtual N1 × (N2·N3) plane.
  SCRAMBLED (DEFAULT): walked in BANDS of `wl` planes with the per-plane
  structure fused into the band while it is L2-hot. NATURAL: one of two
  raced FORMS — the cycle walk (the scrambled pass, then the plane pass
  permuting the planes along the cycles of the axis-0 permutation with one
  plane of buffer) or the STRIP form (axis 0 in cache-resident column
  strips of `nsw` columns through a strip-pitched scratch, the digit
  reversal resolved inside the strip, natural order written back in place,
  then the planes in place — the walk MKL uses per axis, with our kernels).
- **Per plane** the raced STRUCTURE: a 2D IL child plan, or the flat axis-1
  column pass + the K=1 row plan created through the front door (so N3 is
  served by its own 1D verdict: ZTURN-T at every band length, `[k1ztt]
  N=4096: replay ZTURN-T chain 8.8.8.8 tile=1024 src=wisdom` at every
  create of the long-N3 cells, in both classes).
- **One race at create** over structure × width (× form × strip width for
  the natural cell), banked `s= wl= tf=` (`nf= nsw=`) on the rank-3 row of
  the cell's order; **the threaded race** at the plan's T over partition ×
  structure (× form): the BAND arm (prefix stages digit-split, disjoint
  bands with the structure fused) and the PLANE arm (column strips, then
  plane ranges), banked `cmt= cmtt= cmts=` (`cmtf=`). Per-worker clones are
  route-equivalence-checked at create; `vfft_ilnd_mt_passes()` counts
  engagement and every threaded number below carries it at 100%.
- Correctness behind the numbers: `ilnd_probe` (DC, roundtrip, naive-DFT
  spot bins; both structure arms; the banded walk, the in-place execute,
  the threaded execute and the strip form each BITWISE their reference;
  replay with zero races), `api_matrix_gate`.

Protocol (`bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --3dil`, one process per run, scratch copy of
the shipped store): all arms OUT OF PLACE; O-NATIVE = this tier, MKL = rank-3
`DFTI_COMPLEX_COMPLEX` `DFTI_NOT_INPLACE` (its measured-fastest 3D
configuration; its `REAL_REAL` arm runs 1.4–2.2× slower in the same runs);
one-thread samples pinned to core 2 at HIGH, a 300 ms pace before each
sample's cachebust and ≥ 5 ms untimed warm-up, 9 rounds with reversed arm
order, medians; T=8 unpaced (a pace parks both teams), both engines on
the 8 P-cores, MKL's team created before our pool pins, our pool torn down
before every MKL sample. `~` = the delta sits inside the control arm's
spread (a tie). Ratio = MKL / ours. One session, cool machine, 2026-09-15:

```

**The verdicts behind the table** (the same session's create logs). Scrambled
one thread: structure/width per cell — 16³ flat/8, 32³ flat/32, 64³ child/8,
128³ flat/8, 32×16×64 flat/8, 64×128×32 flat/16, 256×64×16 child/64, the odd
cells flat/9 (their chain's span), 16×16×4096 flat/16, 8×16×12288 child/8,
32×32×4096 child/8. Natural one thread: the cycle form everywhere except
128³ (flat, strip 512) and 32×32×4096 (flat, strip 256), where the strip form
won its race (6.24 vs 6.79 ms; 15.0 vs 16.6 ms), and 36×20×28 (a tie); the
cycle form keeps the cells whose cube fits L3, where the strided strip reads
cost more than the cheap move pass.

**The threaded race at T=8** (the create's own arms, same run, alternated,
min of 3 — the robust numbers at these sizes; serial = the same tier at one
thread inside the race; natural = cycle form's best arm vs strip form's
best arm):

 The strip form won the natural threaded race at 10 of 14 cells, on two
 quiet runs: the strips give every worker independent in-scratch work with
 no cold scattered plane writes. Strip width matters at the long cells
 (one page visit per plane per strip): the arm times fall to 256–512
 columns; the pool runs 8..1024 under the L2 budget.
```

**Refuted and deleted (2026-09-15):** the fused natural form — the
scrambled banded walk through a scratch cube, each plane written to its
natural position — lost to the cycle form at every one-thread cell by
3–27% and at 13 of 14 threaded cells (record: `docs/research/.../probes/IL3D/`,
`docs/design/ilnd_natural_fused_design.md`). A permuting plane pass is one
extra cube sweep however it is arranged; the strip form is the one that
pays none.

**Open, not built:** the axis-0 chain is raced as a bare column pass. At
N1 = 32 it sometimes picks a single radix-32 stage, which leaves the axis
natural by itself and no strip form to race, and that cell then serves
slower (20.1 ms) than a two-stage chain with strips (15.5 ms): the chain
race does not see the natural class's form; a joint chain × form race for
the natural cell is a design of its own.

## 3. vs MKL — 1D R2C

R2C is the clearest embodiment of the split-layout trade: the **packing tax** that costs
us single-thread is the *same* lane-batched layout that makes K-split MT trivially parallel
(independent lanes, no barriers, no shared transpose buffer). So r2c **loses single-thread
and wins big multi-threaded** — throughput over single-core latency, by design
([transforms/real/README.md](../../src/core/transforms/real/README.md)). dag via the real
dispatcher (`vfft_r2c_plan_create`/`execute`, SPLIT, **JIT-wired**) vs MKL DFTI real r2c
(CCE); same fairness as §1; correctness vs a reference DFT (r2c is natural order). The
dispatch routes **rfft** at low K (JIT-specialized — see below) and **decoupled-stride** at
K≥32. Source: `bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --r2c [--mt]` → `vfft_perf_tuned_r2c{,_mt}.csv`.

### 1D C2R (backward) — the natural split path

c2r (complex→real, the r2c inverse) gets the **same** split-layout treatment, and it's the
direct mirror of r2c's story. The public API hands c2r a **split** half-spectrum (the r2c
output), so the fast packed c2r — which needs a *packed* half-spectrum — was unreachable, and
the old path forced the slow decoupled-**stride** backward (~0.44–0.46× MKL). New this session:
a **fused natural initiator** (`c2r_execute_natural`, the inverse of rfft's natural terminator)
reads split re/im **directly** through the fast packed cascade — **no repack**. vfft's c2r front
door now runs a natural-vs-stride bake-off (mirror of r2c's), picking per cell; the forced-stride
hardcode is gone. Roundtrip `c2r(r2c(x))==N·x` is the gate (all e-14). Source:
`bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --c2r [--mt]`.

### 1D INTERLEAVED r2c/c2r, K=1 — the D2 zr2c route (like-for-like vs MKL's home layout)

The first **interleaved-vs-interleaved** real-transform comparison - both engines consume/produce
the packed CCE plane, no layout excuse on either side. Ours = the D2 composite (`vfft.c` zr2c
route, shipped 2026-08-13): reinterpret x[N] as z[N/2] (zero work) -> child c2c(N/2) NATURAL ->
z->z Hermitian fold; c2r is the mirror with the fold leading. Two child routes: **route 0** =
OOP-IL child, **route 1** = natural in-place cascade child. MKL = DFTI_REAL CCE **DFTI_INPLACE**
- its best real arm (V6), backward on its own twin descriptor. Gates: cross-engine fwd
elementwise + each engine's backward vs N.x (all cells 3.7e-16..1.4e-15). Medians of 5, pinned
core 2, pace 300 ms. Ratio = MKL/ours: >1 we win.

**2026-08-22: these numbers come from the FRONT DOOR** - `vfft_create(VFFT_R2C/VFFT_C2R)` -
which is what the library actually runs. Every earlier figure in this section was measured by a
bench that hand-assembled the composite (a C2C plan at N/2 plus direct fold calls) and compared
that OUT-OF-PLACE shape against MKL IN-PLACE. Two consequences, both correcting DOWNWARD-biased
old numbers: the hand shape used three buffers where the executor uses two, and the placement
axis was mismatched. The in-place column below is the like-for-like comparison and had never
been measured before - the in-place real path shipped 2026-08-13 and no bench built one.
Source: `bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --zr2c` -> `vfft_perf_tuned_1d_zr2c_fd.csv`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 r2c WINS EVERY CELL, both placements. In-place >= out-of-place everywhere
 except 4096. c2r wins at the small end and in-place from 8192 up.

 THE c2r OOP COLUMN IS A KNOWN-BAD ROUTE PICK, not an engine result. All 37
 shipped kind-5 route rows are src=migrated with no ns= - nothing was ever
 raced; a structural rule (place=oop -> route 0) was written down once. Where
 the race disagrees, forcing route 1 gives:
     2048   0.97x -> 1.12x      4096   0.66x -> 0.82x
     8192   0.81x -> 1.01x      65536  0.88x -> 0.88x
 i.e. the banked pick costs up to 27-35% on c2r OOP. Seeding those rows and
 re-racing is the open item (audit G3); until then read the c2r OOP column as
 "what the stale verdict serves", not as the engine's reach.

 UNRESOLVED: front-door route-0 OOP c2r runs ~22% slower than the identically
 shaped hand-built arm (2048: ~1680 vs ~1373 ns, reproducible). Same algorithm
 on paper, so the difference is buffer placement - the plan's internal scratch
 vs the bench's, or 4KB aliasing. Do not bank a front-door c2r OOP number
 until that is explained.

### 1D ODD c2c — the K=1 IL tier for odd N (2026-09-06)

Odd N (and odd·2) is served by the K=1 IL tier's own engines, raced per
cell at plan time and banked: the pair, the three-stage chain (odd-legal
since 09-04, expressible to 27³) and the flat mixed-radix DIT
(`src/core/oop/il_flatdit.h`, route `flat`), which reaches any N over the
registry radices up to 2¹⁸. The planner enumerates the flat chains
beside the pairs and the chain (24 compositions per cell, logged when the
cap bites), races each stage's kernel form on real data, gates every
candidate against an independent mixed-radix long-double reference and
banks the winner's chain, forms and tile width on the cell's kind-3 row
(`il_route=flat il_flat=… il_forms=… il_tw=…`). Both placements, both
directions, both order classes (natural: the conjugate pipeline, same
stage order; scrambled: the transposed pipeline, reverse order), replay
bit-identical; `flatdit_gate` is the machine proof. Bluestein remains only for factors
no chain expresses.

Front door, `bench_1d_vs_mkl --k1noop` (K=1, natural order, out of
place, INTERLEAVED) vs **MKL DFTI complex**, single thread, cachebusted
and paced, one cell per process, spectra cross-checked elementwise.
Measured 2026-09-06 with the bound executor and the tile axis; a run
whose rate column fell out of the bench's normal band (the host's
throttled state) was discarded and the cell rerun after a cool-down.
Run-to-run spread of the ratio at a quiet cell is about ±4%.

245025 (the largest cell the tile probe used) has no quiet-state bench
run yet and is left out rather than quoted from a throttled one. The
previous table (2026-09-05, before the bound executor and the tile
axis) had 1215 at 0.93×, 16807 at 0.93×, 117649 at 0.96× and 137781
at 1.06×.

Before this tier 1215 ran Bluestein at 15.1 µs and every odd N above
19683 ran Bluestein at the next power of two, unmeasured; the real
transforms' bridge inherits every cell through the front door.

**The SCRAMBLED order class (2026-09-05).** A `VFFT_ORDER_SCRAMBLED`
request at any cell the K=1 IL tier races is its own wisdom cell
(`ord=scr`), raced from its own pool — every natural engine plus, at a
non-power-of-two, the flat chains in their scrambled class — and never
compared with the natural verdict. The
scrambled flat DIT is the natural plan minus its final scatter: the last
stage writes the plane's block order (the mixed-radix digit reversal,
position b·R+l = bin natbase[b]+l·N/R) and its inverse is the transposed
pipeline (stages in reverse, IDFT + post-twiddle-conjugate twins).

the bound executor, forward):

**Execution (2026-09-05).** The engine binds one call record per stage
at plan time (kernel, buffers, tables, strides, counts) and execute
walks the list: no planning arithmetic or resolution per call, and a
t2cp stage runs as ONE call through the kernel's own block loop.
Same-run A/B (`bind_ab`, spectra bitwise identical): the per-block
driver loop it replaced cost 1.01–1.05× (98415 1.049, 4095 1.036,
19683/59049 1.011).

**The tile axis (2026-09-06).** The cascade's tcut in flat form: the
stage suffix runs depth-first per tile (one block of a raced stage
span), raced by the planner after the forms and banked as `il_tw=`.

**The flat DIT engine.** An un-turned mixed-radix DIT: the plain leaf,
then one in-place sweep per remaining factor with per-block broadcast
twiddles (modulus N/D_s), natural order by redirecting the last stage's
stores. Three kernel forms serve its stages, raced per stage:

- **t2cp** — the packed-complex pre-twiddle column kernel, one digit per
  call, any run.
- **msz** — the split-body kernel with interleaved edges
  (`codelets/zil/avx2/boundary_split/radix{3,5,7,9,15}_z_msz_avx2.c`,
  `--zp-msz`; `mszb` backward): the msg mid's body between an
  unpack-only deinterleave and reinterleave, lanes left unordered, with
  the il_odd_count_tail §3 arms so it takes any run. Wins the run-4
  stages 2.1–2.5×; parity on long runs of 5 and 7; loses at radix 9 and
  on runs of 3, where the race keeps t2cp.
- **t2csgn** — the short-run tail kernel (t2csg: two-group column form,
  generated twiddle stream) with its group loop in-kernel over a base
  table (`codelets/zil/avx2/pure_il/radix*_z_t2csgn_avx2.c`,
  `--cil-t2csgn`, backward twins), one call per stage; on the last stage
  the driver hands it the groups in ascending natural-base order, so
  consecutive groups fill adjacent output lines. The count-1 last stage
  goes from 1.6–1.7 to 0.9–1.0 ns per point at 98k–138k.

Standalone (`ilfd_probe --race`) the engine runs 0.88–1.22× MKL across
405–137781 in both directions; the planner's per-cell pick above decides
where it serves. Its remaining deficit is the 5^k and 7^k families, where
MKL's radix-5/7 sweeps are cheaper per element.

### 1D ODD c2c — the K=1 IL tier MULTITHREADED (2026-09-07)

The flat mixed-radix DIT threads its own bound call lists
(`oop/il_flatdit_mt.h`, `docs/design/odd_n_engine.md` §8.2): every stage
is a set of independent units (the leaf's columns, a mid stage's blocks, a
tail stage's groups) and the tile axis's tiles are self-contained, so the
two arms are BLOCKS (every stage by units, one dispatch per stage) and
TILES (the wide prefix by units, then disjoint tile ranges walked
depth-first, then the wide tail by units). Both are loop restrictions of
the serving lists — threaded output is bitwise the serial output, gated
both classes and both directions (`flatdit_gate`). The verdict is raced
at the plan's T against serial with every legal tile width as an arm of
the tiles family (the threaded width differs from the one-thread width at
19683, 59049 and 177147), steady-state samples, banked `il_mt= il_mt_t=
il_mt_tw=` on the class's kind-3 row; below L2 the race banks serial (405,
1215, 4095). Nothing is cloned. `vfft_ilfd_mt_passes()` counts engagement;
every number below carries it.

**Same-run, the create race itself** (T=8, REPS executes per sample after
two warm passes, min of 3 alternated rounds; serial = the same tier at one
thread in the same race):

the single-thread table above stays measured against MKL pinned to one

### 1D ODD/PRIME r2c/c2r — full coverage, priced vs MKL (2026-08-27)

The 1D real transforms now serve **every odd N in both directions and
both layouts**, through two raced routes:

- the native **rfft** engine (real-arithmetic codelets, radix-smooth odd
  N — the historical route), and
- the **c2c bridge**: promote real → complex → c2c(N) → keep the hp1
  bins forward; Hermitian-extend → inverse c2c → Re backward (odd N has
  no Nyquist, the mirror is exact). The child rides the pair/chain/prime
  engines, so prime and awkward N are covered; the bridge is also the
  only c2r-odd route (the half-spectrum inverse never existed at odd N
  before this).

**The pick is raced per cell at create** — both arms as finished plans,
never a rule. It flips both ways: 63/255/4095 serve the bridge,
1215 keeps rfft.

vs **MKL DFTI real CCE** (1D, `mkl_set_num_threads(1)`, same process,
alternated min-of-15, spectra cross-checked bin-for-bin at every cell):

```

 4095   smooth         0.30×        0.31×     bridge (raced in)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Primes beat MKL outright** — MKL's odd real path is weak while the
bridge inherits the full c2c prime machinery (Rader/Bluestein with the
cascade inner). The remaining smooth-odd losses (1215, 4095) are the
known **rfft-tier quality gap**, a codelet campaign of its own — not a
layout or coverage issue; c2r 1215 additionally reflects an uncalibrated
c2c(1215) chain.

Also shipped with the coverage:

- **In-place odd real** — the padded CCE plane contract holds at odd N
  (2·(N/2+1) = N+1 doubles), and the bridge is aliasing-safe by
  construction; aliased roundtrips at 63/101/129/255 measure ~5e-16.
- **Batched MT** — transform-contiguous odd batches thread through the
  clone machinery (the safety gates recurse into the bridge's child):
  T=8, K=64, MT == ST bitwise, engagement proven:
  101 → **4.82×**, 129 → **7.09×**, 1021 → **6.15×**.

### 2D NATURAL order — native tier, both transforms, multithreaded (2026-09-04)

Natural row order on the n1 axis is served natively for the whole IL
2D family — pow2 and odd chains, prime N1 — with no reorder pass: the
leaf stage of the column chain writes its rows at their natural
positions directly (the leaf takes source and destination pitches
independently, so a digit-reversal permutation becomes a base+stride
redirection of the last stage). Natural cells race their chain under
the natural pass (the best chain differs from the scrambled one — the
leaf radix sets the scatter width), bank on their own `ord=nat` wisdom
row, race chain-vs-Bluestein on odd N1, and race serial-vs-threaded.

T=8, i9-14900KF, MT == ST bitwise in both directions, spectra checked at
natural indices, engagement counted:

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

The threaded natural walk has two legal partitions, raced per cell:
the matched arm (digit-split prefix stages, the leaf scatter by block
range, then row slabs) and column strips (the whole natural pass over
a column range); the band arm is structurally unavailable because the
scatter crosses bands. On the c2c tier both partitions land within a
few percent of each other, so its smaller speedup relative to the real
tier at equal column work is not a partition effect; the row-slab
phase (rows cannot fuse into bands under natural order) is the
suspect, and a per-phase measurement is the open item.

## 4. vs MKL — 2D R2C

dag tiled 2D real-to-complex (`fft2d_r2c.h`: tiled R2C row pass + native column c2c)
vs MKL DFTI 2D real (CCE), single-thread, same fairness as §1–§3 (per-cell order-flip,
cachebust + pace, best-of-5, ns timing). dag output is **split** (out_re/out_im) and
**scrambled** (DIT); MKL is CCE-interleaved natural — so the definitive correctness gate
is the roundtrip `r2c+c2r == N1·N2·x` (all e-14/e-15), not an elementwise compare. Plans
are per-cell tuned; the inner column c2c is JIT-specialized. Source:

### 2D C2R (backward)

The inverse — complex (CCE / split) → real 2D, `fft2d_r2c.h`'s c2r path, **PATIENT-calibrated**
(separate `fft2d_c2r_wisdom`; c2r's optimum ≠ r2c's — all 4 cells WON their own gate),
single-thread (the c2r backward is **serial** — not yet tile-parallel). Roundtrip
`r2c+c2r == N1·N2·x` is the gate (all e-14/e-15). Measured **cooled**, median of 3. Source:
`bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --2dc2r` → `vfft_perf_tuned_2dc2r.csv`.

#### 2D C2R — multi-threaded (T=8)

The c2r backward is **now tile-parallel** (new this session): its row pass reads the padded
col-FFT scratch and writes reals to a *distinct* user buffer, so tiles are independent — the
same tile-parallel pool as the r2c forward, each thread with its own scratch slot + inner-pack
tid (the prior serial path was forced only by a hardcoded inner-slot index, not a real data
hazard). The column c2c IFFT stays serial — the self-scaling ceiling, as in §2/§4. **MT-vs-ST
gate:** the threaded c2r equals the single-thread output bit-for-bit (rt e-14/e-15 — race-free).
MKL's threaded 2D-real backward is anomalous on this host (§4), so we report dag **self-scaling**,
not a vs-MKL ratio. Cooled, median of 2. Source: `bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --2dc2r --mt`.

### 2D R2C/C2R — the NATIVE INTERLEAVED tier vs MKL CCE (2026-08-26)

The true-IL 2D real tier (`docs/roadmap/fft2d_real_il_design.md`: batched/ROWSPLIT
zr2c row doors + the n1c/t2c column chain with the L2-banded walk; pure IL end to
end, no split pads) — since M3 (2026-08-26) **THE serving** for every interleaved
2D real caller. Verdicts (row route `rw=`, band width `wl=`, chain) are raced at
create and banked in the direction-shared `lay=il` cells. vs **MKL's real CCE 2D
arm** (rank-2 `DFTI_REAL`, `CONJUGATE_EVEN_STORAGE=COMPLEX_COMPLEX`, out-of-place,
single-thread). Same-run 5-arm race, per-round order flip, cachebust, medians of 9
rounds, core-2-pinned at HIGH priority, all creates warm (banked routes serving).
Output is scrambled along N1 (the tier's contract) — correctness gates are the
elementwise naive compare + pair roundtrip in `il2d_real_gate` (e-15/e-16), plus
each bench cell's own-pair roundtrip. Source: `bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --2dreal`.

### 2D R2C/C2R — the native tier MULTITHREADED (2026-08-27)

Both passes of the native IL real tier thread. The row pass rides the
transform-contiguous clone MT (slabs of whole rows, clones proven
output-equivalent at create); the column pass distributes with a
**raced partition** — a band arm over the suffix stages (exchange-free
by construction: workers re-read exactly the rows they produced) plus a
digit split of the wide prefix stages (three pointer edits per the
emitted kernel, zero new codelets), or column strips where a
single-stage chain has no row axis. The fold's ℝ-linearity keeps the
rows/columns wall — one join, measured at ~100 ns.
**The engage decision is raced per cell and banked** (`cmt=`/`cmtt=`
in the direction-shared `lay=il` cell; a verdict serves only at the
thread count it was raced at); kill/force `VFFT_IL2D_NO_COLMT`;
engagement counters `vfft_tc_mt_dispatches()` +
`vfft_il2d_col_mt_passes()` are public and asserted in the gate.

**Speedup over the SAME tier at one thread** (the vs-MKL-MT head-to-head
is a separate future same-run arm), T=8, same-run alternated min-of-20,
MT == ST bitwise gated both directions:

```

```

The progression at 1024×1024 r2c locates the work: rows-only 1.75× →
plus banded/strip columns 2.82× → plus the digit-split prefix **7.69×**
— the full-plane prefix stage was the entire remaining serial residue.

VectorFFT's calibrated wisdom path measured against FFTW3 with
`FFTW_MEASURE` planning. FFTW3 split-complex API
(`fftw_plan_guru_split_dft`) so the layout matches VectorFFT exactly —
no interleave / deinterleave overhead on the FFTW side.

```

Headline:

> **VectorFFT beats FFTW3 on 202/207 (97.6%) of bench cells. Median
> speedup 3.21×, mean 4.25×, range 0.92×–17.79×.**

The median against FFTW3 (3.21×) is meaningfully higher than the
median against MKL (2.64× from Section 1). FFTW3 is genuinely behind
on power-of-two and prime-power cells once N·K outgrows last-level
cache — the calibrated wisdom routes around L3 thrashing while
FFTW's plan search doesn't capture the cache-residency effect.

**Top wins (large prime-power and pow-of-2 cells):**

| Cell | Factors | Ratio |
|------|---------|------:|
| N=390625 (5^8) K=256 | 5×5×5×5×5×5×25 | **17.79×** |
| N=78125 (5^7) K=256 | 5×5×5×25×5×5 | 17.51× |
| N=65536 K=256 | 4×4×8×16×32 | 15.89× |
| N=131072 K=256 | 4×4×4×4×4×4×32 | 15.57× |
| N=100000 K=256 | 4×25×5×8×25 | 15.07× |

At these sizes FFTW drops to ~1 GFLOP/s while VectorFFT sustains
~17–20 GFLOP/s — 1D batched FFT against a 16M+ working set is
memory-bound, and our wisdom-tuned multi-stage factorizations keep
inner radices L1-resident across the K=256 batch.

**Weakest cells (Bluestein primes — pre-wisdom snapshot):**

| Cell | Ratio (pre-wisdom) |
|------|------:|
| N=179 K=256 (Bluestein) | 0.92× (FFTW wins) |
| N=59 K=256 (Bluestein) | 0.93× (FFTW wins) |
| N=59 K=32 (Bluestein) | 0.96× (within noise) |

> **Note:** these FFTW3 ratios are the **pre-Bluestein-wisdom** snapshot. With the calibrated
> per-(N,K) `(M, B)` wisdom these sub-1.0× cells turn into wins (the vs-MKL §1 table shows every
> Bluestein cell ≥1.0×). A fresh `bench_1d_vs_fftw` run is pending; the table above is the historical
> lower bound, not the shipped result.

### r2r family

The DCT / DST / DHT wrappers are built atop our R2C using Makhoul (DCT-II/III)
and Lee 1984 (DCT-IV); DST-II/III piggyback on DCT-II/III with sign-flip
+ index reversal; DHT is a free derivation of R2C output. Specialized
straight-line N=8 codelets (`gen_dct8.py`, `gen_dct3_n8.py`) bypass
Makhoul for the JPEG block size.

All numbers here are **single-threaded** (T=1) vs FFTW3 with `FFTW_MEASURE`
planning, split-complex API.

### DCT-II (REDFT10) — `bench_dct2_vs_fftw`

| N | K | vfft ns | fftw ns | ratio |
|--:|--:|--------:|--------:|------:|
| 8 | 1024 (JPEG) | 2,300 | 3,400 | **1.48×** |
| 8 | 4096 | 9,500 | 11,100 | 1.17× |
| 16 | 1024 | 12,400 | 39,200 | 3.16× |

| 128 | 256 | 28,900 | 88,300 | 3.06× |

Wins all measured cells (range 1.17–3.16×).

### DCT-III (REDFT01) — `bench_dct3_vs_fftw`

| N | K | vfft ns | fftw ns | ratio |
|--:|--:|--------:|--------:|------:|
| 8 | 1024 (JPEG) | 2,500 | 2,900 | 1.16× |

| 1024 | 256 | 416,000 | 1,495,500 | **3.59×** |

> **The only v1.0 r2r loss vs FFTW3** is DCT-III at N=8 K=4096 (0.60×).
> Both N=8 codelets (`gen_dct3_n8`) target the JPEG-range K (256–1024)
> and don't optimize for very-large-K layout. FFTW switches to a
> different large-batch code path that still beats us at K≥4096. v1.1
> fix: a K-specialized DCT-III N=8 variant — same flavor as the JPEG
> codelet, different cache layout for K≥4096. Tracked in
> [docs/v1_1_codelet_roadmap.md](../v1_1_codelet_roadmap.md).

### DCT-IV (REDFT11) — `bench_dct4_vs_fftw`

After the specialized N=8 codelet landed:

| N | K | vfft ns | fftw ns | ratio |
|--:|--:|--------:|--------:|------:|
| 8 | 256 | 800 | 2,700 | 3.38× |
| 8 | 1024 | 4,300 | 9,400 | 2.19× |
| 8 | 4096 | 17,600 | 36,900 | 2.10× |
| 16 | 1024 | 8,900 | 35,900 | **4.03×** |
| 32 | 1024 | 28,300 | 74,200 | 2.62× |
| 64 | 1024 | 60,800 | 161,800 | 2.66× |
| 256 | 256 | 59,500 | 186,000 | 3.13× |
| 1024 | 256 | 354,200 | 1,482,100 | **4.18×** |

Wins all measured cells (range 1.85–4.18×). The pre-codelet build
showed losses 0.53–1.06× at small N — codelet flipped that.

### DST-II / DST-III (RODFT10 / RODFT01) — `bench_dst23_vs_fftw`

| Variant | N | K | vfft ns | fftw ns | ratio |
|---------|--:|--:|--------:|--------:|------:|
| DST-II | 8 | 256 | 600 | 2,400 | **4.00×** |
| DST-II | 16 | 1024 | 16,100 | 38,900 | 2.42× |
| DST-II | 32 | 1024 | 39,100 | 78,500 | 2.01× |
| DST-II | 64 | 1024 | 90,800 | 173,600 | 1.91× |
| DST-II | 256 | 256 | 82,600 | 198,600 | 2.40× |
| DST-II | 1024 | 256 | 553,900 | 1,484,500 | 2.68× |
| DST-III | 8 | 256 | 700 | 2,900 | **4.14×** |
| DST-III | 16 | 1024 | 21,400 | 40,800 | 1.91× |
| DST-III | 32 | 1024 | 41,100 | 83,200 | 2.02× |
| DST-III | 64 | 1024 | 94,700 | 176,700 | 1.87× |
| DST-III | 256 | 256 | 84,300 | 207,100 | 2.46× |
| DST-III | 1024 | 256 | 544,900 | 1,507,000 | 2.77× |

Wins all measured cells. Range 1.85–4.14×; strongest at small N where
FFTW's DST is less specialized than its DCT path.

### DHT (Hartley)

Per session notes, DHT lands **1.9–2.8× over FFTW** across the same
N/K range. A dedicated `bench_dht_vs_fftw` per-cell table was not
written for v1.0 — `test_dht.c` confirms 22/22 cells pass at machine
precision vs FFTW reference, but timing data was not preserved. v1.1
adds the bench so the DHT row matches the DCT/DST detail level.

### Headline (r2r vs FFTW3, T=1)

> **VectorFFT wins 53/54 measured r2r cells vs FFTW3** (1.16–4.18×
> range; mean ~2.5×). Single loss: DCT-III at N=8 K=4096 (0.60×) —
> codelet-fixable in v1.1.

| Family | Ratio range | Cells | Wins |
|--------|:-----------:|:-----:|:----:|
| DCT-II | 1.17–3.16× | 6 | 6/6 |
| DCT-III | 0.60–3.59× | 7 | 6/7 |
| DCT-IV | 1.85–4.18× | 11 | 11/11 |
| DST-II | 1.91–4.00× | 6 | 6/6 |
| DST-III | 1.87–4.14× | 6 | 6/6 |
| DHT | ~1.9–2.8× (summary) | — | — |

MKL TT was also benched for DCT-IV (4–13× wins) and DST (timing-only —
MKL TT computes a different PDE-oriented math convention, so the
comparison is informational, not apples-to-apples). FFTW3 is the
correct r2r baseline.

## 6. Multi-threaded scaling

**Native IL intra-transform MT (2026-08-27)** — the single-plan MT for
the interleaved tiers, every engage decision raced per cell:
§4 → "the native tier MULTITHREADED" (2D real: **7.69×/7.70×** at
1024², one plane, one plan) · §2 → same heading (2D c2c: 7.73×/7.60×
at 8192×64) · §1 → "K=1 scrambled cascade — intra-transform MT"
(one 1D transform: 5.43× at N=262144).

### 1D C2C — direct MT vs MKL

See **§1 → "Multi-threaded — vs MKL at T=8"** for the head-to-head: 129/129 wins at T=8, median
3.76× over MKL (K=32: 3.00×, K=256: 4.38×). R2C inherits the same K-split MT (its inner C2C threads).

DHT         N=4096 K=4096 59296500  1.06   1.55   1.87
```

Best speedup at T=8: **2.65×** (DCT-IV at N=1024 K=1024). Typical
**1.6–2.4×** across cells.

### Why not 8× at T=8?

The DCT/DST/DHT family is implemented as **three sequential passes**:

```
Pass 1: pre-permute / pre-twiddle    — bandwidth-bound
Pass 2: inner FFT (R2C or C2C)       — has its own MT
Pass 3: post-process / post-twiddle  — compute + memory mix
```

Each pass reads + writes the full N·K data once. Total memory traffic
≈ 3 × N·K × 16 bytes per call. At N·K = 16M (N=4096 K=4096), that's
~768 MB per call. DDR5 on this CPU saturates around 25 GB/s, putting
a wall-time floor around 30 ms per call — close to what we measure
(27 ms at T=8). Adding more threads can't beat physics.

### Where the 8× comes back: v1.1 fused codelets

The v1.1 codelet roadmap
([docs/v1_1_codelet_roadmap.md §2](../v1_1_codelet_roadmap.md))
adds specialized straight-line codelets — `e10_*` for DCT-II,
`e11_*` for DCT-IV, `r2hc_*` for R2C — that fuse all three passes
into one tight kernel. Arithmetic intensity rises dramatically:

| Generation | Memory traffic / call | T=8 ceiling |
|-----------|----------------------|:-----------:|
| Pre-v1.0 (sequential wrappers) | 3 × N·K·16 bytes | ~1.4× |
| **v1.0 (parallel wrappers, current)** | **3 × N·K·16 bytes** | **~2.6×** |
| v1.1 (fused codelets) | 1 × N·K·16 bytes | ~5× projected |

The v1.0 parallel wrappers lift the floor from 1.4× to 2.6×. Fused
codelets lift the ceiling from 2.6× to ~5× by eliminating the
multi-pass bandwidth traffic. Both are needed for the full picture.

DHT scales worst (1.6–1.9× at T=8) because its pre-phase is one big
sequential memcpy of N·K doubles — left intentionally non-parallel
because it's pure memory bandwidth, and a single optimized memcpy
typically beats T smaller memcpys when the limit is DRAM throughput.
DHT will benefit most from v1.1 fused codelets.

## 7. Per-codelet performance (VTune-grade)

For deep per-radix analysis at K=256 see
[docs/vtune-profiles/](../vtune-profiles/) — one detailed profile per
radix R ∈ {4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20, 25, 32, 64}. Top-line:

| Radix | Retiring (% of pipeline slots) | Bottleneck |
|------|:-----:|------|
| R=4  | 86% | compute-peak (port 0/1 at 96/91%) |
| R=8  | 72% | DFT-8 critical path dependency chains |
| R=10 | 63% | radix-5 + radix-2 FMA chains |
| R=11 | 59% | Winograd, machine-clears flagged |
| R=12 | 57% | radix-3 + radix-4 FMA chains |
| R=13 | 60% | Winograd + Sethi-Ullman |
| R=16 | 25% | store-bound + L1 latency (post-prefetch) |
| R=20 | 54% | radix-5 FMA chains |
| R=25 | 50% | hybrid compute/store |
| R=32 | 34% | L1 store-DTLB overflow (~80 pages) |
| R=64 | 27% | load + store DTLB overflow (~160 pages) |

Most radixes retire 50–86%. R=16/32/64 hit memory-system bottlenecks
that the codelet alone can't fix (huge codelets exceed DTLB capacity);
these benefit specifically from the cost model's variant-aware
selection (T1S / LOG3 / BUF) which routes around their bottlenecks
when wisdom shows another protocol wins.

## 8. Hardware caveats

### These numbers are from one CPU

All measurements: i9-14900KF (Raptor Lake, hybrid 8P+16E), 5.7 GHz
turbo, AVX2. Numbers move on:

- **Sapphire Rapids / Emerald Rapids** — should be similar or better
  (same uarch family, often better memory subsystem). Wisdom carries
  over without recalibration.
- **Zen 4 / Zen 5** — different uarch. CPE numbers shift; recommend
  re-running `cpe_measure` and `calibrate_tuned` on the target host.
  Architectural advantages (cost model, wisdom, MT) carry over; per-
  cell speedups may differ.
- **AVX-512 hardware** — codelets exist, but CPE table currently
  holds only AVX2 measurements. Re-run cpe_measure on AVX-512 host
  for accurate estimate-mode plans there.

### Consumer PC vs calibration host

The numbers in this doc are from the calibration host running clean
(idle background, performance plan, single P-core pinned). On a
consumer PC running normal background load, expect:

- **vs MKL ratios**: similar (within 5–10% — the win is structural)
- **Estimate vs wisdom mean**: drifts up to 1.3× on a noisy host (was
  1.19× on the calibration host)
- **MT scaling**: slightly weaker (T=8 ceiling drops 10–20% under
  thermal/freq fluctuation)

### What `Ts > 8` looks like

We bench up to T=8. On the i9-14900KF's hybrid 8P+16E config, T=16
or T=24 starts using E-cores, which run ~60% the IPC at higher
latency. Per-thread efficiency drops sharply past 8. For workloads
that benefit from many threads, the bench grid should be extended
(v1.1 work).

## 9. Reproducing these numbers

### vs MKL

```
python build_tuned/build.py --vfft --src build_tuned/benches/bench_1d_vs_mkl.c --mkl
build_tuned/benches/bench_1d_vs_mkl.exe        # single-thread -> vfft_perf_tuned_1d.csv
build_tuned/benches/bench_1d_vs_mkl.exe --mt   # T=8 (K>=32) -> vfft_perf_tuned_1d_mt.csv
```

Requires MKL ILP64 (Intel oneAPI install); single-thread uses `mkl_set_num_threads(1)`, `--mt`
uses 8. 238 cells × ~1 second = ~5 minutes wall (single-thread).

### 1D C2C vs FFTW3 (single-thread)

```
python build_tuned/build.py --vfft --src build_tuned/benches/bench_1d_vs_fftw.c --fftw
# fftw3.dll must be co-located with the exe (already copied into build_tuned/).
build_tuned/benches/bench_1d_vs_fftw.exe \
    build_tuned/vfft_wisdom_tuned.txt \
    build_tuned/results/vfft_perf_tuned_1d_fftw.csv \
    build_tuned/results/vfft_acc_tuned_1d_fftw.csv
```

Long run — 1–2 hours on the calibration host because of FFTW's
`FFTW_MEASURE` plan-search cost on the larger prime-power cells
(N=823543 alone takes ~30 min at K=256). Run with no other significant
load for cleanest numbers.

### r2r vs FFTW3 (single-thread)

```
python build_tuned/build.py --vfft --src build_tuned/benches/bench_dct2_vs_fftw.c --fftw
python build_tuned/build.py --vfft --src build_tuned/benches/bench_dct3_vs_fftw.c --fftw
python build_tuned/build.py --vfft --src build_tuned/benches/bench_dct4_vs_fftw.c --fftw
python build_tuned/build.py --vfft --src build_tuned/benches/bench_dst23_vs_fftw.c --fftw
build_tuned/benches/bench_dct2_vs_fftw.exe
build_tuned/benches/bench_dct3_vs_fftw.exe
build_tuned/benches/bench_dct4_vs_fftw.exe
build_tuned/benches/bench_dst23_vs_fftw.exe
```

Requires FFTW3 (vcpkg install or local build). ~30 seconds wall total.
Each binary plans with `FFTW_MEASURE` so first-run setup is the bulk
of the time; benched min over 21 reps after 5 warmup.

### MT scaling for DCT/DST/DHT

```
python build_tuned/build.py --vfft --src build_tuned/benches/bench_mt_dct.c
build_tuned/benches/bench_mt_dct.exe
```

~30 seconds wall. Run with no other significant load on the machine
for cleanest numbers.

## 10. Zen 4 — a second calibration host (2026-09-03)

Everything above was measured on the i9-14900KF. This section is the
first set of numbers from a **different microarchitecture**, calibrated
from scratch into its own per-host wisdom store. It answers one
question: does the measure-everything design port, or was it tuned to
one chip?

### 10.1 Host and toolchain

| | Zen 4 host | (14900KF, for reference) |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 8640HS, Zen 4 (Phoenix), 6C/12T, **35 W** laptop part | Raptor Lake 8P+16E, 5.7 GHz |
| L1d / L2 / L3 | 32 KB 8-way / 1 MB / 16 MB shared | 48 KB 12-way / 2 MB / 36 MB |
| single-core boost | ~4.9 GHz | 5.7 GHz |
| compiler | GCC 16.2.0 (MSYS2 UCRT64), `-march=native` → `znver4` | GCC 15.2 |
| library ISA | **avx2** (`VFFT_ISA=avx2`; the IL tier has no AVX-512 registry) | avx2 |
| FFTW | 3.3.10 built from source, two variants: `--enable-avx2 --enable-fma` and the same `+ --enable-avx512`, both `--with-our-malloc`, bound at runtime via `VFFT_FFTW_DLL` | — |
| wisdom | `generated/wisdom/Zen4/` — **empty at the start of the day**, no 14900KF verdict reused | `generated/*.txt` |
| cache discovery | `VFFT_L1D_DISCOVER=0` (pinned 48 KB / 2 MB, the shipping default; see `docs/design/cpu_discovery.md`) | same |

MKL is not installed on this host and would be the wrong yardstick on
AMD; **all Zen 4 comparisons are against FFTW, avx2 build vs avx2
build** unless stated. The `@meta` line in every Zen 4 store file reads
`host=amd-f25m117 isa=avx2 l1d=49152`.

### 10.2 What was calibrated

All racing at `VFFT_PATIENT`, into the Zen 4 store, in this order:

| N | racer | banked |
|---|---|---|
| 1024 | `calibrate_k1` (kind-3 pair, route × pair × `il_kv` × bwd form) | `2p 16×64 il_kv=20` fwd (1265.9 ns cal.), `il_kv=0` bwd; split OOP `2pa 16.64` |
| 1024 | front door, 4 cells | in-place attach `mode=ilp`; natural in-place `mode=ilp` |
| 4096 | `calibrate_k1` | `2p 64×64` fwd, `il_kv=16` bwd; split `twl 32×128` |
| 4096 | `calibrate_zchain` (kind-4 cascade, chain × route × `t2q` × every tile width) | **ZTURN `4.4.8.8.4`, `t2q=0`, `zt_tw=1024`**, 15.5 µs joint |
| 4096 | front door, 4 cells | both natural cells → `mode=zcasc` (cascade beat the 64×64 pair: 9.7 µs vs 12.2 µs cal.) |

Every axis `docs/design/measurement_arms.md` §3 marks RACED at these N
has a Zen 4 row. The 14900KF chose `4.4.4.4.4.4` for the same 4096
cascade cell with the same 1024-cplx tile: six radix-4 interior stages
there, three interior stages with two radix-8 mids here. Same
architecture, different balance point, both found by the race — this
is what per-host wisdom is for.

### 10.3 Results — canonical `bench_1d_vs_fftw --k1noop`, isolated cells

K=1, interleaved, out-of-place, natural order, both engines in one
process, cachebust + 200 ms cool between engines, both flip orders,
cross-engine elementwise correctness on every row. FFTW planned with
its own `fftw-wisdom` PATIENT wisdom imported (`VFFT_FFTW_WIS`);
MEASURE gave the same numbers at 1024 (the Bailey search surface is
too small for rigor to matter).

| N | order | vfft min / med ns | FFTW avx2 min / med ns | ratio min / med | gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1024 | vfft first | 1039.8 / 1043.7 | 1120.6 / 1185.6 | **1.08 / 1.14** | 2.7e-13 |
| 1024 | FFTW first | 1001.0 / 1020.6 | 1067.5 / 1081.1 | **1.07 / 1.06** | 2.7e-13 |
| 1024 (FFTW MEASURE) | vfft first | 1028.9 / 1030.0 | 1082.8 / 1136.1 | 1.05 / 1.10 | 2.7e-13 |
| 1024 (FFTW MEASURE) | FFTW first | 1085.6 / 1120.6 | 1219.8 / 1229.5 | 1.12 / 1.10 | 2.7e-13 |
| 4096 | vfft first | 5035.7 / 5045.3 | 6041.8 / 6292.6 | **1.20 / 1.25** | 1.5e-12 |
| 4096 | FFTW first | 4744.5 / 4747.3 | 6520.1 / 6543.9 | **1.37 / 1.38** | 1.5e-12 |

Reading it: **ahead of FFTW on every run at both sizes**, 5–14% in the
Bailey band and 20–38% in the cascade tier. The margin grows where the
cascade's two-conversion SoA interior starts to amortize.

### 10.4 FFTW alone, both ISA builds (standalone, PATIENT, same timing shape)

| N | placement | avx2 ns | avx512 ns | FFTW plan |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| 1024 | OOP fwd | 1010.7 | 926.0 | dit/16 → dit/32 |
| 1024 | in-place fwd | 1272.0 | 1153.0 | dit/4 → dit/32 |
| 4096 | OOP fwd | 8559.2 † | 5850.8 | dit/4 → dit/64 |
| 4096 | in-place fwd | 14862.3 | 9683.6 | dit/8 |

† FFTW's own planner is not deterministic: the standalone PATIENT run
chose `dit/4` at 8.6 µs while the `fftw-wisdom` tool's PATIENT plan the
bench imported ran 6.0–6.5 µs in-bench. The bench ratios in 10.3 are
against FFTW's *better* showing.

AVX-512 buys FFTW 8% at 1024 and **32% at 4096** (a radix-64 leaf on
interleaved data). The library's avx2 bench time at 4096 (4745–5036 ns)
is still below FFTW's avx512 standalone (5851 ns), cross-protocol, so
hold that one loosely — but it says which half of the cascade design
carries the win: the layout decision (shuffle-free SoA interior), not
the vector width.

### 10.5 Zen 4 vs 14900KF, same cell (N=1024, K=1 OOP natural)

| | 14900KF (§1, 2026-08-16, 6 reps) | Zen 4 (10.3) | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| bench, best rep | 848 ns | 1001 ns | 1.18× |
| bench, median | ~897 ns | ~1054 ns | 1.17× |
| boost clock | 5.7 GHz | ~4.9 GHz | **1.16×** |
| **cycles** | **≈ 4,830** | **≈ 4,900** | 1.5% |
| winning plan | `2p 32×32` blocked, `il_kv=67` | `2p 16×64`, `il_kv=20` | — |

Per clock the two cores execute this transform at the same rate,
despite Zen 4's 60% smaller ROB, smaller FP register file and 32 KB L1.
Both have two 256-bit FMA pipes; the desktop's remaining advantage on a
single L1-resident transform is clock alone, and the planner absorbed
the smaller register file and cache by choosing a different pair. (No
bench-protocol 4096 datum exists for the 14900KF; its calibrator
`ns=` values are not comparable across hosts — see 10.2's note on
calibrator timing.)

### 10.6 Scope

- Two cells, one host, single-thread, avx2 vs avx2 by decision. The rest
  of the Bailey band (128..512) and the cascade above 4096 are a few
  minutes of `calibrate_k1` / `calibrate_zchain` each, into the same
  folder.
- Calibrator `ns=` values in the store are search-loop times and must
  never be quoted as results (Zen 4 4096: 9.7 µs banked vs 4.7–5.0 µs
  in the bench). Only the canonical bench protocol counts.
- `VFFT_L1D_DISCOVER` was left at 0, so the store's `l1d=49152` stamp
  is the pinned value, not the silicon's 32 KB. The Bailey pair is not
  L1-gated and the tile-width search benches every legal width, so no
  candidate was excluded by it; the 2D L2 band fence is the one consumer
  that would see a different candidate set with discovery on.
- No 14900KF verdict was served at any point: the Zen 4 folder started
  empty, and the bench's store-miss path now races rather than reading
  the wisdom file's row (`_race_stride_cell`, 2026-09-03).

Build with `CC=C:\Users\<you>\msys64\ucrt64\bin\gcc.exe` (build.py
now finds it and clamps AVX-512 out of the driver ISA to match the avx2
codelet library — on Zen 4, `-march=native` alone selects the AVX-512
registry and the link fails).
