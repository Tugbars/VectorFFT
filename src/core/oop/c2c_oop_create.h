/* c2c_oop_create.h — the c2c OUT-OF-PLACE create tier (migration step 25).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * ------------
 * The c2c out-of-place arm of _vfft_create_inner. It returns on every path, so
 * it lifts out behind its own guard, leaving the real and trig tiers that
 * follow untouched.
 *
 * OOP IS NOT IN-PLACE WITH A COPY BOLTED ON
 * -----------------------------------------
 * It is a separate serving with its own wisdom family (W->oop / vw2 oop
 * records) and its own K=1 route. That is why this tier is a sibling of
 * c2c_ip_create.h rather than a branch inside it: the two consult different
 * banked verdicts and build different plans.
 *
 * THE K=1 SPECIAL CASE
 * --------------------
 * `K == 1 && !ob` is where the K=1 machinery lives — the zsplit/zturn cascade
 * replay (_k1z_wisdom_replay) and, on a miss, the race that banks it
 * (_k1z_race_and_bank). Those two are the front door to the three-tier K=1
 * strategy (mono <=64, Bailey 128-1024, cascade >=2048); the tier itself does
 * not choose a tier, it replays or races for one.
 *
 * `ob` splits the same way it does in-place: a caller-supplied batch handle is
 * checked and served exactly, otherwise the plan owns its buffers.
 *
 * WISDOM, NOT HEURISTIC
 * ---------------------
 * Every open choice here is either replayed from a banked verdict or raced and
 * then banked. A banked line reads back as a verdict; nothing in this file may
 * grow a hand-written cutoff.
 *
 * POSITION IN vfft.c IS LOAD-BEARING
 * ----------------------------------
 * Not a standalone header. It calls file-scope statics that live in vfft.c, so
 * it must be included after those are defined and before _vfft_create_inner.
 *
 * The six parameters are the block's complete free-variable set, derived
 * rather than guessed: cfg, ob, W, reg, N, K.
