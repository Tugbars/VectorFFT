/* k1_commit.h - the K=1 plan's replay, race, and commit.
 *
 * How a single-transform cell gets its plan: consult wisdom, and on a miss race
 * the candidates and bank the winner. Extracted from vfft.c as migration
 * step 19; see docs/design/refactor_migration_plan.md.
 *
 * THE PRECEDENCE LADDER, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * Every decision in this file follows the same order, and the order is the
 * design:
 *
 *   1. an ENV pin      - beats everything, and NEVER banks. An override is an
 *                        experiment; if experiments wrote to the store, one
 *                        debugging session would poison every later run. That
 *                        is the tcut law.
 *   2. a BANKED verdict - honoured at every rigor tier. Banking it is the point
 *                        of having measured it once.
 *   3. RACE and BANK    - on a miss, build the candidates as finished plans,
 *                        time them, keep the winner, write it down.
 *   4. a STRUCTURAL default - only when nothing above applies.
 *
 * REPLAY AND RACE ARE SEPARATE FUNCTIONS ON PURPOSE
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * _k1z_wisdom_replay reconstructs a plan from a banked record and MEASURES
 * NOTHING. _k1z_race_and_bank measures. Keeping them apart is what makes a
 * warmed store cheap - a create on a hit never touches a clock - and it is also
 * what makes the harness's replay-purity assertion meaningful: a cell that
 * races during what should be a replay has the clock inside its own baseline.
 *
 * _k1_il2p_apply_kv IS NOT A RACE
 * -------------------------------
 * It applies a banked kind-3 il_kv verdict - the leaf/mid kernel FORM pair -
 * and measures nothing. The race that produced that verdict lives offline in
 * dp_planner_il.h and never runs at create. An il_kv of 0 keeps create's own
 * structural default (blocked at R>=32).
 *
 * Worth knowing: il_kv has NO fingerprint field, so two plans differing only in
 * kernel form fingerprint identically and the migration harness cannot see a
 * change here. This is one of the few places in the tree where obj_equiv is the
 * only guard.
 *
 * THREE BANKERS, THREE DIFFERENT CELLS
 * ------------------------------------
 * The order axis does not share a cell with the scrambled one:
 *   _bank_nat_1d      in-place natural   (ord=nat)
 *   _bank_natoop_1d   out-of-place natural
 *   _bank_scrmode_1d  the ord=scr mode cell (mode=ilp|zcasc|conv)
 * They are separate so that a natural-order create can never perturb the
 * scrambled plan, and vice versa - the regimes are calibrated independently
 * because they are genuinely different engines, not one engine with a flag.
 *
 * INCLUSION CONTRACT
 * ------------------
 * Include after the engine prelude, after vfft_internal.h, and AFTER
 * _vw2_persist - the bankers call it, and it stays in vfft.c. Same back-edge as
 * zr2c_build.h has; both would be freed by moving _vw2_persist to support/.
