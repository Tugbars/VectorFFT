/* il2d_col.h — THE COLUMN-AXIS PASS DESCRIPTOR (2026-09-06, phase 1 of
 * the rank-N interleaved tier, docs: memory fftnd_il_campaign).
 *
 * Everything the interleaved column pass over an N-row plane of rn complex
 * per row needs: the chain, its kernels and tables, the banded walk, the
 * natural leaf redirection, the column-axis Bluestein and the column-MT
 * verdict. The 2D plan owns one instance (il2d_col: axis N1 over rows of
 * N2, or hp1 for the real tier); a rank-N IL plan owns one per column axis
 * (fftnd_il.h: axis 0 over N1 rows of N2*N3, axis 1 per plane over N2 rows
 * of N3). The ROW pass is not here: rows belong to the plan that owns them.
 * The column-pass functions (il2d_cols.h, il2d_tier.h) take a pointer to
 * this; nothing in it depends on the plan struct. */
