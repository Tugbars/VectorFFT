/**
 * fftnd_il.h — the rank-N INTERLEAVED c2c tier (2026-09-06; design of
 * record: docs/roadmap/fftnd_il_design.md). Rank 3 today; rank 4 by the
 * same composition.
 *
 * NOT the split fftnd.h: different layout, different axis model, shares
 * nothing with it but the directory. Interleaved has no lane axis, so the
 * tier is built from the 2D IL tier's two pieces — the COLUMN-AXIS PASS
 * (il2d_col.h descriptor, il2d_tier.h build + execute: stage kernels
 * taking a leg stride and a contiguous count) and the K=1 IL ROW pass.
 *
 * Row-major with N3 contiguous, a rank-3 cube is:
 *   axis 0 : a column pass over the virtual plane of N1 rows x (N2*N3)
 *            complex — the 2D column pass with pitch N2*N3, unchanged
 *            kernels, chains and tables; wide over the cube.
 *   axis 1 : a column pass over each of the N1 planes of N2 rows x N3.
 *   axis 2 : the row pass over N1*N2 rows.
 *
 * THE STRUCTURE IS A RACED ARM (owner 2026-09-06, "only racing both to each
 * other can tell"), never an architectural default:
 *   arm 1, the RECURSION : axis 0 wide, then a plain 2D IL c2c CHILD plan
 *            (its own (N2,N3) wisdom cell) executed per plane — axis 1
 *            and the rows with every 2D verdict (chain, forms, band, row
 *            route) raced as a standalone 2D transform;
 *   arm 2, the FLAT tier : axis 0 wide, then per plane this tier's OWN
 *            axis-1 column pass (its chain raced in the 3D context, the
 *            same build function) and the row pass over the plane's rows.
 *
 * THE AXIS-0 BANDED WALK (the 2D tier's wl, E1.2, at rank 3): a "row" of
 * the virtual plane IS a plane of the cube, so a band of wl rows is a
 * band of wl planes. fwd = the wide prefix stages 0..cut-1 over the cube,
 * then per band the stage SUFFIX depth-first followed at once by the
 * per-plane structure on the band's planes while they are L2-hot (the 2D
 * tfuse: rows fused into the band). bwd mirrors the Hermitian chain: per
 * band the reversed suffix then the planes, then the reversed wide prefix.
 * Same kernels, same tables, same count as unbanded — only loop order and
 * base pointers differ (bitwise identical output; ilnd_probe checks it).
 *
 * Both structure arms x every legal width are ARMS OF ONE alternated race
 * on a scratch cube at create (min of 3); the winner banks s= and wl= tf=
 * on the cell's rank-3 lay=il row beside the axis-0 chain tokens (chain=
 * blu= forms=) and the flat arm's axis-1 tokens (chain1= ...); the child's
 * verdicts live on the child's cell. VFFT_ILND_ARM=1|2 and VFFT_ILND_WL=w
 * pin for a probe and never bank.
 *
 * THE NATURAL CLASS (2026-09-07; docs/design/3D_natural_il_design.md): its
 * own ord=nat cell. Axis 0 stays the SCRAMBLED pass (in place, banded,
 * threaded as above), so after it position q holds the plane whose
 * natural index is natp[q] (the chain's digit reversal — the very table
 * the 2D natural class scatters by). The per-plane structure, which reads
 * and writes every plane anyway, is run OUT OF PLACE and writes each
 * finished plane to its natural position, following the permutation's
 * cycles with ONE plane of buffer: save the cycle's first plane, fill each
 * vacated position with the plane that belongs there, the saved plane
 * closes the cycle; fixed points run in place. Inside the plane, axes 1
 * and 2 are natural by the natural 2D child (out of place) or the natural
 * axis-1 pass plus the natural row plan. Backward: the plane pass runs
 * first with the inverse permutation (out of place: a direct permuted
 * copy per plane; in place: the inverse cycle walk), then the scrambled
 * axis-0 backward in place. No scratch cube, no extra sweep; the cost is
 * cold destination writes and one plane copy per cycle. Both placements.
 *
 * MULTITHREADING (the 2D tier's INC-C ported, 2026-09-07): two partition
 * arms, both pure loop restrictions of the serving walk (no arithmetic
 * change => MT == ST bitwise, gated by the probe):
 *   BAND arm  (wl > 0): the wide prefix stages digit-split (INC-3b: whole
 *             planes per digit, one dispatch per stage), then workers take
 *             disjoint BANDS — each band = suffix stages + the fused
 *             per-plane structure, exchange-free (the planes a worker
 *             finishes are the planes it just produced);
 *   PLANE arm : workers take disjoint COLUMN STRIPS of the virtual plane
 *             and run the whole axis-0 chain (barrier-free: a column
 *             pass never mixes columns), then disjoint PLANE ranges for
 *             the structure. The only arm of an unbanded or Bluestein
 *             axis 0.
 * In the natural class the structure is not fused into the bands (it runs
 * in cycle order): both arms finish with a CYCLES phase in which workers
 * own disjoint cycles (assigned longest first) and one plane buffer each.
 * At the plan's T the partition arm and the STRUCTURE are raced together
 * (serial with the one-thread structure, then band and plane with each
 * buildable structure): the structure that wins at one thread is not the
 * one that wins threaded (measured 64^3: child+band 70 us, flat+plane
 * 103 us, while at one thread the two structures tie). Banked on the
 * rank-3 row as cmt= (0 serial | 1 band | 2 plane), cmtt= (the T raced
 * at) and cmts= (the structure the threaded verdict runs with); s= stays
 * the one-thread verdict. A verdict serves only at its own T.
 * Every threaded sample runs REPS executes after warm passes: a worker's
 * cache partition settles over the first milliseconds of executes
 * (measured: round-0 means 1.5-5x the steady state), and single-execute
 * samples alternating between arms time the transient, never the steady
 * state.
 * The per-plane structure mutates plan state (a 2D child's scratch, the
 * row plan's scratch, an axis-1 Bluestein or natural scratch), so worker
 * t > 0 runs its CLONE: a 2D child clone route-equivalent to the primary
 * (_ilnd_child_equiv), or a row-plan clone route-equivalent
 * (_tc_clone_equiv) plus its own axis-1 scratch. Any clone failure tears
 * that structure's set down; with no clones MT declines — never a
 * half-cloned dispatch. The pool is the one owner (support/threads.h);
 * the plan's T is the snapshot, stride_pool_workers_for the one clamp.
 * VFFT_ILND_MT=0|1|2 pins the partition for a probe (never banks).
 * Engagement counter: vfft_ilnd_mt_passes() (vfft.c) — a threaded result
 * without it is vacuous. VFFT_ILND_PROF=1 prints per-phase ns.
 *
 * Every pass commutes with every other (each is a Kronecker factor). Output
 * order: DEFAULT/SCRAMBLED = each column axis digit-reversed by its chain,
 * rows natural; NATURAL = natural.
 *
 * Contracts: C2C, rank 3, howmany == 1, either placement (one plan, one
 * wisdom row per order cell: every pass is alias-tolerant), every order.
 * Real and rank 4 follow in later phases — refused loudly until then,
 * never bridged.
 *
 * POSITION IN vfft.c IS LOAD-BEARING: after il2d_tier.h (the column build
 * and execute, _tc_clone_equiv's declaration), k1_commit.h (support/race.h)
 * and the wisdom readers, before fftnd_create.h (which dispatches here for
 * rank-3 INTERLEAVED c2c).
